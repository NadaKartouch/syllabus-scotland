The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using NodeJS, and modern front-end development with React. We’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...\nUnder Construction\nThis is the repo for the updated CYF Syllabus.\nFor the version that is being taught in our first London class, please check Syllabus-book\n"},"lesson0.html":{"url":"lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\nTerminal\nGit\nIDEs\nHomework\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from StackOverflow. Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built\na website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about\nthe tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during\nthe course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your\nCodePen website to a web address under https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location\nwhere other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that\nyou have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,\nplease read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please\nask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain\nthem in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen. Help >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note of the\nlocation of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository. How does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.\nThis is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an index.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name,\nfind the settings icon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source, then hit\n\"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages section.\nYou should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\".\nClick the link, verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as command line)\nwill be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to interact with you computer\nfaster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like you\nto get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nCommonly used commands\nThere's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course to allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory. Can also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please find\ninstructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the instructions,\nopen a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You will see something\nlike this:\n\n  \n\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool called \"Git Bash\".\nWhen the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line, please open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control). It's\nlike Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\nExtract from Git Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by si618 explains very well why we use Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use, and by far the most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen learn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more intermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically to fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a repo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the local repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to setup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in our case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install Git git config --global user.name  and git config --global user.email .\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we recommend becoming \ncomfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the steps for the different \nworkflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with Pull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our code.\nGithub is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large companies,\nlike Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they do: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you will\nbe using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop your apps\nquickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of having to search\nGoogle for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides \"auto-completion\".\nThis means that it will give you suggestions of what you can can write next, while\nyou are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign\nit to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave the\nwindow to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files can be\ndone directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from something called\na \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of your IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without\nhaving to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of VS Code. Please\ngo ahead and install it, then try opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free to check out their\nwebsites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now. Please use the\ninformation in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name, please send\na link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update CSS.\nCommit your changes to Github and verify that https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name\nhas been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right!\nWhen it happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"html-css/lesson1.html":{"url":"html-css/lesson1.html","title":"Week 1 - Semantic HTML and CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nSemantic HTML tags\nCSS selectors, CSS cascade, Pseudo-classes such as :hover/:focus\nBox model: margin/padding/border etc...\nCSS specificity\n\n\nWhat makes a web page?\n\nSeparation of Concerns: In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. (Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this GitHub repository. Fork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal commands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming):  Work in pairs to determine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\n\nCSS Inheritance\nSome CSS styles applied to one element will be \"inherited\" by their child elements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements, such as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and borders, don't get passed down to children.\n\nIn English, the word inherit refers to something, like the color of your eyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how \"child\" HTML elements can inherit styles from \"parent\" HTML elements.\n\nWe'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and why.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the background properties to add a assets/jumbotron-background.jpg to the jumbotron. Did these styles have \"inheritance\"? Why do you think they did or did not?\n\nNow that the background image is in place, the text is difficult to read. The text needs to be white.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use just one CSS rule to set all of the text in the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do you think some styles, like text color, get inherited?\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n    background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\n\nThe Cascade\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The \"cascade\" is a set of rules which the browser uses to choose what to do when two CSS rules conflict. Take the following example:\n.btn {\n    color: red;\n}\n.btn {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\nShould the .btn be red or blue? When identical selectors are next to each other like this, the browser lets the last one override the first one. But in a real-world scenario, you may have CSS scattered across different files. To solve this, we use the cascade.\n\nExercise: Read the section on the cascade. Then pair up. In the example, there are two paragraphs. Pick one paragraph and explain to your partner why it has a particular background color. Then ask your partner to explain the other paragraph.\nExercise: Work in pairs to give each one of the navigation menu items a red border (#ce5f31). This border should only appear when the mouse is hovering over it or the item has focus. Then use what you've learned about the cascade to give the first navigation menu item (\"Home\") a different color border.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n    border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about advanced CSS selectors and then practice by playing this CSS selector game.

You can use the browser's Device Emulation instead.\n\n"},"html-css/lesson2.html":{"url":"html-css/lesson2.html","title":"Week 2 - Responsive Web and layout","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 2\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nResponsive web design\nMedia queries\nContent layout: flexbox\nContent layout: floats (maybe)\nContent layout: relative and absolute positioning (maybe)\n\n\nResponsive Web Design\nWhen we build for the web, we're making websites that can be viewed in a phone, a laptop, a tablet and more. To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n    body {\n        background: red;\n    }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays might be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is larger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nContent Layout: Flexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\nIf you finish early, you can add some text in each box and position it in the middle of the box.\nExercise: Working independently, try to position the articles and images side-by-side under the \"Upcoming Events\" section. Use this screenshot to guide you. If you get stuck, go ahead and ask your partner. Never be afraid to ask!\nHint: you might need to create a container for the text pieces!\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the Flexbox Froggy game as you can. This will stretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's ok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.\n(Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from Flexbox Zombies\n(Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about positioning content in CSS using floats and absolute positioning.\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process. Look at the documentation for Bootstrap 4 and look at their examples to see how they are building components.\n\n"},"html-css/lesson3.html":{"url":"html-css/lesson3.html","title":"Week 3 - Frameworks","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 3\n\nDesign frameworks\nBootstrap 4 and HTML/CSS frameworks\nHTML forms\nGit branching and pull requests\nNaming patterns (OOCSS, BEM)\n\n\nDesign Frameworks\nA design framework is a collection of re-usable code snippets which you can use to build a website. It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or \"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.\n\nThe main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.\nThe BBC's Global Experience Language is a design framework. It calls it's components design patterns and in the foundations section you'll find discussion of layouts and typography.\n\nExercise: Look at the Promos design pattern. As a group, let's try to name all the parts of a Promo that we'll need to consider when designing the component? Now do the same with the Carousel pattern.\n\nOpen-source HTML/CSS/JS Frameworks\nBootstrap and Foundation are popular examples of open-source HTML/CSS/JS frameworks. They help you construct your own design framework by providing a number of re-usable components that are common for web applications.\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we load in our HTML pages. Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a grid layout as well as several components.\n\nExercise: Fork this repository and follow the instructions in the readme to create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise illustrating git branching and pull requests. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull request. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master branch and update your copy.\n\nHTML Forms\nForms provide tools for visitors to your webpage to interact by entering details, making selections or performing other actions. When you write an update on Facebook, you're entering a message into a form field, and \"posting\" that message to Facebook.\n\nExercise: Read this guide on HTML forms. Then add a form to your new page. The form should include fields for the user to write their name, email address and a message. It should also include a button.\nExercise: Look at the documentation for Bootstrap's form components. Update your form to use Bootstrap's form groups, form controls and buttons. When you're done, create a new branch, commit, and issue a pull request.\n\nNaming Patterns (OOCSS/BEM)\nWe use naming patterns to organise our code so that it is easier for colleagues to work with our code -- and easier for us to work with our colleagues' code. In a team of developers, you will need to understand, read and make use of a naming pattern.\nBootstrap uses a naming pattern called Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS). The goal is to define an object, which is another word for a component, and come up with a set of re-usable class names appropriate for that object.\n\n    You have successfully completed your task.\n\n\n    You did not complete your task.\n\n\n.alert {\n    padding: .75rem 1.25rem;\n    border-radius: 0.25em;\n}\n.alert-success {\n    background-color: green;\n}\n.alert-error {\n    background-color: red;\n}\n\nExercise: As a group, let's explore the naming patterns in Bootstrap's Card component. How is the object-oriented naming pattern used here?\nExercise: Read the documentation on Bootstrap's Card styles. Apply style adjustments to the cards in your project example.\n\nOne of the goals in a naming pattern is to communicate purpose. Let's look at the following example of Bootstrap's Card component:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\nWe have three types of class names here:\n\n.card is the object.\n.card-block, .card-title, and .card-text are sub-objects.\n.card-inverted is a modifier.\n\nWith Bootstrap's naming pattern, we know an object is a single word class name like .card, .btn or .alert. But our other two types of class names share the same naming pattern: .card-inverted and .card-block.\nThe Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming pattern is an attempt to overcome this. It introduces separate naming structures for all three types of class names.\n\nThe object is called a \"Block\": .card.\nThe sub-objects are called \"Elements\" and are written with 2 underscores: .card__block, .card__title and .card__text.\nThe modifier is written with 2 dashes as: .card--inverted.\n\nIf we changed our Card example to use BEM syntax, it would look like this:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\n\n\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\" - Phil Karlton\n\nHomework\n\nLook at as much of the Bootstrap 4 Documentation as you can.\nAdd Bootstrap to the website you've been building for your homework.\nAdd a new HTML page to the website you've been building for your homework. Use Bootstrap's form components to a contact form to this page.\nModify the articles in the website you've been building for your homework. Modify their markup to use the BEM naming pattern so that they all look the same.\n\nResources\n\nHTML Forms at Marksheet.io\nBuilding Forms at ShayHowe.com\nBootstrap 4 Documentation\n\nPrepare for next class\nNext week, we will begin learning and programming JavaScript.

Tie into the idea of how in a program these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our sandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students to shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object would be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have decided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the objects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects are required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with the students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction – could be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in programming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of this exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed class and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each instruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in programming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to codepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left, click the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression, such as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result, in the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions in the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a variable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You can assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now a variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not contain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string or boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You can also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate a statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1\n15\n3195803798\n1.4\n0.0000005\n0\n-23\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers (decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers. Numbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math operators that you would expect:\n2 + 2 // 4\n2 - 5 // -3\n2 * 3 // 6\n10 / 2 // 5\n3 * -2 // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher precedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or double quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape” them by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the JavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a quote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is called string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that can only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different operators for booleans (analoguous to Boolean algebra). The most important ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:!true // false\n!false // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // false\nfalse && true // false\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // true\nfalse && true // true\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2, 2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13\nExercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r * pi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female. Make it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of women and the total number of students.\nSolution: console.log(Math.round(7 / 17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent when it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple jsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"js-core/lesson1.html":{"url":"js-core/lesson1.html","title":"Week 4 - Hello JavaScript","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 1\n\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nHello World\nData  Types\nVariables\nConditionals: If/else\nLoops\n\nThis class is based on the Node Girls JS Workshop\n\nGetting Started\n\nDownload and install the latest Current version of NodeJS - from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/\n\nTo test that it was installed and running properly, go to your terminal and run the command:\nnode -v\nYou should get the node version printed on your terminal, for example, v7.3.0\n\nFork the repositroy - https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises and Clone it locally.\n\nOnce you have the repo locally, go to the folder on your terminal and run node main.js\n\n\nYou should get Hello World printed on your Terminal.\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it say \"Hello world!\". This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using something called a console.log().\nconsole.log()\nWhen we ran the command node main.js - that did log to the console printing the words Hello World to the terminal. \nLet's open the file main.js and investigate its contents\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you notice about the code? Anything you don't understand? Notice the semicolon, the dot, the parantheses - these are all elements of JavaScript Syntax\n\nTry to console.log() something different, for example, Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!. (run node main.js after each change and look at the output in the console)\n\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\n\nComments\nYou can put comments to help you and others understand your code - use // to add a comment (or if it is a multi-line comment, then use /* and */ around your comment)\n// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code\nconsole.log('Hello world!');\n\nconsole.log('Hello World'); // comments can also be in the same line like this\n/*\nI can also make comments\nover more than one line if necessary\n*/\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\n\nExercises What are the comments in that main.js script.\n\nNode?\nWe ran our JavaScript using Node -  Node is is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Wikipedia\n\nExercises What are other \"places\" where we can run JavaScript code?\n\nData Types\nIf you played around with console.log() in the last step, you might have noticed that words always have to be inside quotes or else the code breaks, whereas numbers can work without quotes. Why is this? Well these are different data types in JavaScript. You'll need to learn the three main data types to get started coding (later we'll look at some other data types, like objects and arrays).\nStrings\nStrings are simple text, ranging anywhere from a single character to lengthy paragraphs. A string is always written inside a pair of quotes (single or double).\n'node girls'\n\nNumbers\nNumbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes like strings, and can just be written as is.\n100 // an integer number\n100.89 // a decimal number (floating point)\n\nBooleans\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a \"boolean\" value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\ntrue\n\nYou've seen what they look like, now make sure they are what you think they are. There is a built-in feature in JavaScript which allows you to check the type of a particular value: typeof.\nWrite this code in your main.js, and run it (using node main.js in the terminal):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Hello world!');\n\nYou should see string printed to the console.\n\nExercise Now try that three times, once for each data type. Log the typeof for three different values: \"Code Your Future\", 6 and false. You should get different output for each one.\n\nVariables\nWhen you code, you'll want to create shortcuts so you can easily refer to things without writing out the same value every time. In JavaScript we have variables, which allow us to store values to use later.\n\nThink of variables names like labels on boxes, while the value of the variable are the contents of the box - you could change the contents of a box and leave the label intact, the contents of the boxes can have different types, the boxes should have good labels (a box of books being labeled pens would be very confusing),\n\nPhoto from Khan Academy\n\nTry it out\nYou create a variable using the keyword var, which lets the application know that you're about to store a value. You also have to give a name to your variable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a string called \"Glasgow\".\nvar city = 'Glasgow';\n\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write the name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing out Glasgow every time. You don't put quotes around a variable name.\nTry to run the above code, and see what is printed to the console.\n\nExercise\nIn the above example, what will happen if we change the second line to console.log(\"city\") - Do you notice the difference? What do you think will be the output?\n\nYou should have some code left over from previous steps which looks something like this (maybe even with comments):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Code Your Future');\nconsole.log(typeof 6);\nconsole.log(typeof false);\n\n\nExercise: Now that you know how to create variables, rewrite this code. This time, define these values as variables at the top of the file, create a variable called courseName and assign it the value Code Your Future. Then create a variable called courseDuration and assign it the value 6, and a variable called isHard and assign it the value false.\nRefer to the three variables that you just created to get their types (i.e. console.log(typeof courseName) etc...)\nIs your output the same?\n\nIf/Else Statements\nNow we're going to start adding in some logic. So far we have been logging the same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according to different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else statement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the outcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do something else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and something else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of true or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the variable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two things are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one (=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are there to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log('Hello world!');\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(':(');\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable from true to false.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print 'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator, which looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1 // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0 // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or negative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print 'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'. \nHint: You can use the > or  signs.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\nFor Loops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing the same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in JavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of times, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value. It is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an iteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're at. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i=0\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen for the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less than or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the loop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put i++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni+=2\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the loop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i=1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there. The length is set to be less than or equal to 10, as we want the loop to end there. And we are increasing the value of i by one each time.\n\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that loops over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing only every second number. So it should return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10....\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 divisble by 5. \nSee if you can think or more than one way to solve this.\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nFunctions\nWe've been writing code that performs different actions, but sometimes you want to group code together to achieve a particular end. This is where functions come in.\nA function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when it is \"invoked\".\nThe syntax of a function looks like this:\nfunction functionName (parameters) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nYou can call a function whatever you want, just like a variable. You can also give a function different values every time you run it which are called \"parameters\".\nTo make the function run, we invoke it like so:\nfunctionName();\n\nTry it out\nLet's write a function that adds two numbers together. We'll call it add. We want to add together two different numbers every time, so let's define two parameters to represent this, x and y.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nNotice I've invoked the function underneath, with the paremeters 2 and 3. Inside the function, try to console.log() your parameters and see what happens.\nNow, we want to add these two numbers together, but it isn't enough just to write x + y, since we haven't told the function to return anything. It's time for a return statement. The return statement specifies the value to output.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nRun this code, and hopefully you get the right answer!\n\nExercise \nWrite a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. It should take two numbers as parameters and return the answer.\nExercise\nGo back and copy the code to your previous solution for printing the sum of numbers between 1 and 100. Put this code inside a function.\nChange the function so it accepts any two limits and prints the sum of all the numbers between those limits.\nFor example: addBetween(1,3) should print 6\n\nResources\n\nData Types\nComparison Operators\nArithmetic Operators\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in JavaScript!\n\nFollow this course on Khan Academy.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is the index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second element, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3]\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using .length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the rules...\n\nExercise: \n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list. Hint: For loops\n\nDon't ask a mentor - Google it! Try googling to find the answer if you're stuck. Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nObjects\nNow for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits of information, except objects store the properties of something. For example, you might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time and location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThe syntax looks like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise\nUsing an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence introducing the person. Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does this work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method you can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];\nvar moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\nconsole.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push('United States of America');\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push('United States of America', 'France');\n\n\nExercise: Search .slice, .splice and .pop and tell us what they do\n\nResources\n\nArrays\nObjects\nStrings\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript.

We need to make sure our software is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure our programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause severe bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users of your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example integration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal with unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean different things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments), do something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the return statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if the same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what we want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain input, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the output matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an equality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and complains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in unit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a function result to an expected value.\n\nTogether: Follow the instructions in unit-testing/sum.js!\nExercise: Now you! Take the provided unit-testing/findNeedle.js and turn it into a function that returns a result instead of\nprinting it. Then run it using multiple inputs and make sure it returns the correct results each time!\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. (Wikipedia)\n\nA key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we dive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?\nWe formalise those requirements by writing tests - even before our program is written! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any code yet. Our tests are now RED (the colour represents a failing test).\nNow we want to turn this RED into GREEN. We do this by implementing our function in a way that covers all our test cases.\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions in tdd/findNeedle.js!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any functionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a certain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called refactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore, we call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we refactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not regress.\n\nTogether: Refactor the findNeedle function we just wrote to be implemented using .map() and .filter().\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being equal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if a function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before another thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit testing frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do is provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called Jest. It's created by Facebook and useful for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a later lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The suffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To execute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function. You can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest('test description', function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests. They are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one call of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one file. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10 really zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it into the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to be used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple inputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest runs your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells you how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions, statements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if you have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be covered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to generate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the numbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nResources\n\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\n\nHomework\n\nRead the Wikipedia article about Test-driven development\nSolve the exercises in this repo (using TDD) https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-tdd-exercises\n\nTODO\nResearch\n\nResearch other module formats than CommonJS.

But JavaScript was not meant to be run in console.log: it was meant to make web pages pages dynamic.\nLots of websites are powered by JavaScript today, and some (like Facebook) cannot function at all without it: it's become that important to the look and feel of the website.\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other (parents and children). But JavaScript doesn't know about any of that.\nThankfully, in JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object (Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that JavaScript can work with.\nHere are two examples, HTML and then JavaScript, of how the DOM might look like:\n\n    \n         Welcome! \n         Hello world! \n    \n\n\n``js\nvar document = {\n    body: {\n        h1: \"Welcome\",\n        p: \"Hello world!\"\n    }\n};\n\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the page. Here are some we'll be using today:\n\n``js\n    document.querySelector('#mainHeader');\n    document.querySelectorAll('p');\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll selects all elements (it returns an array).\nOnce you retrieve an element using .querySelector, you can attach an event to it. An event is any action that can be performed on that element. For now, we will just use the click event:\n``js\n    var myButton = document.querySelector('#myButton');\n    myButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\nfunction alertSomething() {\n    alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nYou will notice in the example example that we passed a second argument to `addEventListener`. That second argument is the **function** that we want to invoke when that event has happened.\n\n> **Exercise**:\n> - Fork the repo [here](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/dom-ajax) and clone it locally.\n> - Open `index.html` in your browser.\n> - In `./js/main.js` write code so that when a user presses the **Donate a bike today** button, an **alert** pops up, thanking them for their donation.\n\nThe elements returned by `document.querySelector` have the same properties as a normal HTML element: for example, you can get access to their css **styles**.\n\n``js\n    var myElement = document.querySelector('#myElement');\n    myElement.style.backgroundColor = 'red';\n\nExercise:\nChange your code, so that instead of alerting something when you press the button, it changes the background color of the Jumbotron to red.\n\nUsing the document, you can also create new elements. These elements will not appear until you append them as a child of another element though:\n``js\n    var paragraph = document.createElement('p'); // here we're just creating it, element is not visible yet\n    myElement.appendChild(paragraph); // now the element is added to our view, but it's empty\n\n`document.createElement` accepts as an input any element type. So for example `document.createElement('article')` will create a new article element.\n\nYou can then change the text displayed inside elements using the `innerText` property:\n\n``js\n    paragraph.innerText = \"How are you?\"; // now we can see the text displaying on the screen\n\nExercise:\nWhen Add to learn more button is clicked it should:\n\ncreate a new paragraph element\nset its inner text property to some message you want\nadd the paragraph to the #mainArticles element just below Learn more\n\n\nWe've been using document.querySelector to retrieve a single element.\nTo retrieve an array of multiple elements (that match a specific class name for example, or a specific tag) we use document.querySelectorAll.\n``js\n    //change the background of all the paragraph items on our page\n    var paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll('p');\n    for(var i=0; i\n\nWe've learned that `style` and `innerText` are properties of DOM elements. Image tags can also have `width` and `height`.\n\n> **Exercise**:\n> Every time the **All images** button is clicked it should reduce and width and height of all images on the webpage by `10`.\n\nWhile it's really easy to change styles directly on elements using the `style` property, it is not usually a good idea to mix JavaScript and CSS (see separation of concerns in the first lesson). To solve this, we can use the `className` property to set the class for an element instead of changing its styles directly:\n\n``js\n//before: \nvar container = document.querySelector('#myContainer');\ncontainer.className = \"largeBlock\";\n//after: \n\nExercise:\nRemember the button that changes the color of the jumbotron to red? Go back and try to do that without modifying the styles. You can use the .red class.\nAdvanced Exercise:\n\nWhen you type something into the box below the Jumbotron and click the Add button it should add a new Article below Learn More with what you typed as the inner text. It should then clear the input.\nMake sure you create a proper article that looks like the others above it (it should be an article element, that contains a paragraph element, that contains your text, it should also have the class article).\n\n\nAJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or devices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to millions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for storing your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack app, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a request to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to the client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or pictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other clients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests data or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language (a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It defines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your desired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that Slack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to the web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using Javascript, but you can send HTTP requests with other laguages as well.\nAJAX (= Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a set of useful methods for implementing client-server communication.\n\nAJAX just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server (with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient ----------GET request----------> server returns data to client\nclient ----------POST request (with content)--------->server updates data with content\n\nThe server holds the data, but it only sends it to the webpage when there's a request. The request can be sent after the page has loaded, for example when a user clicks a button.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets. What's great about AJAX is that it makes it look like magic! The server and the client communicate effortlessly:\n\nUpdate a web page without reloading the page\nRequest data from a server - after the page has loaded\nReceive data from a server - after the page has loaded\nSend data to a server - in the background\n\nAJAX Example\nThe instant update: we can write code that makes the web page instantly update its contents (without reloading the page).\nLet's try sending some data from Rares’ phone to the server and see whether it will update the webpage.\n\nhttp://zero-point.github.io/\n\nLet's Code!\nHow does the code work?

It makes programs easier to read and to understand. It allows for us to more easily modify and extend code. It saves space and improves performance.\nAt the most basic level, a function is a series of instructions that can take an input and produce an output. Parameters dictate how the function behaves.\n \nWe've used functions a bit, but now we need to know how to use them well.\nThere are many ways to write code that does the same thing. But are they all equal?\n\nExercise: Let's look at a really obvious example of a function with redundant code. What could we do to improve it?\n\n``js\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes(){\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\n\nIntroducing a simple for loop makes our lives a lot easier. This way we can more easily see what the function does and make modifications.\n\n``js\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes(){\n  for ( var i = 0; i \nExercise: Now, let's look at a different example. Let's say we wanted to welcome mentors:\n\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  console.log(\"Hello Mozafar\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Rares\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Tim\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Ashleigh\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Gordon\");\n}\n\nWe could be lazy and change how we welcome the mentors.\n\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  var mentorNames = \"Mozafar, Rares, Tim, Ashleigh, Gordon\";\n  console.log(\"Hello \" + mentorNames);\n}\nBut it's not quite the output we wanted. And we can be smarter about it. Why not a loop?\n``js\nfunction welcomeMentors(){\n  var mentorNames = [\"Mozafar\", \"Rares\", \"Tim\", \"Ashleigh\", \"Gordon\"];\n  for ( var i = 0; i \n\nSo functions help us to organise and enhance our code. But what makes good design? Is it just \"shorter is always better\"?\n\n## Good Design\n\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other humans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\n\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and extensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these three.\n\nTo\n\n- Ease of Maintenance / Clarity\n    - Naming\n    - Formatting\n    - Commenting\n    - Clear logic\n    - Concise\n    - Avoiding Redundancy\n\n- Reusability\n    - DRY\n    - Single Reponsibility\n        - Avoiding global state (scope)\n        - Predictability and Ease of testing\n\n- Extensibility\n    - Avoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n> Exercise: Find all the design issues with this function.\n\nAs an aside: if you try to run the code it won't work, but not because it's not correct. It's only because it is a fragment of a larger program and lacks some code such as the function updateCorpDatabase(), the initialisation of the global variables referenced (e.g. quarter, profit) and, of course, the HandlesStuff() function also hasn't been called.\n\n``js\nfunction HandlesStuff(inputRecord, savedrecord, income1, income2, expenseType, revenue, expense0, expense1, expense2, screenx, screeny, success){\n\n  var i;\n  for ( i = 0; i What is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, HandleStuff() tells you nothing about what the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables vaguely by separating them through numbers (debt1, expense1, etc). If you find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as expenses[]) or use a more specific name for each variable (such as pastIncome and currentIncome). There is also inconsistency in the use of camel casing (inputRecord versus savedrecord).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to understand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code contributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their reasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/ Formatting: the physical organisation of the code on the page gives few hints about its logical organisation. Layout strategies are used inconsistently throughout the code: incorrect indentation, unnecessary spacing (between the two else ifs) and the long list of parameters is unreadable. This makes the code look messy and confusing.\n\nInput variables: the function's input variable, inputRecord, is set (hardcoded) within the function. If it's an input variable, its value should not be modified. If the value of the variable is supposed to be modified, then the variable should not be called inputRecord.\n\nGlobal variables: the function reads and writes global variables - it reads from quarter and writes to profit. It should communicate with other functions more directly, rather than by reading and writing global variables.\n\nSingle Responsibility: the function does not have a single purpose. It initialises some variables, writes to a database, does some calculations - none of which seem to be related to each other in any way. A function should have a single, clearly defined purpose. This function looks like it needs restructuring: breaking it into multiple functions.\n\nData checks: the function doesn't defend itself against bad data. If quarter equals 0, the expression income2 * 4.0 / quarter causes a divide-by-zero error.\n\nMagic numbers: the function uses several magic numbers: 100, 4.0, 1, 2 and 3. These are numbers that are used directly in an expression rather than saving them first in a variable. This is discouraged as it makes it more difficult to manipulate the values. If we were to save them in a variable they would be easier to find and modify.\n\n\n``js\ntenSquared =  1010\ntenCubed = 1010*10\nx = 10\nxSquared =  xx\nxCubed = xx*x\n\n9. Useless parameters: some of the function's parameters are never used (screenx, screeny and success). They should be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're starting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might need them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n10. DRY principle: the function breaks the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. The expression profit = revenue - expense0 is written 3 times unnecessarily, the only difference being whether it's the first, second or third expense. This variable can be restructured into an array.\n\n``js\nvar expense = [expense1,expense2,expense3];\nprofit = revenue - expense[expenseType];\n\nExercise: We have the following problem to solve, write really bad code that gives the right result. Tell us why it is bad.\n\nWrite a function that will print out the number of vowels that are in mentors' names.\n\nExercise: Now, let's write it well together.\n\nObject Oriented Programming\nThe contents of this section are based on the MDN articles mentioned inthe resources\n\nWhat are abstractions?\n\nAbstraction is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves ignoring the characteristics that we don't care about in order to concentrate on those that we do care about.\n\nSource: http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zttrcdm/revision\n\nExercise: http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/guides/zttrcdm/test\n\nAbstraction is a technique for arranging code into different levels of complexity. At the highest level is code that can be easily understood by a person. At the very lowest level is binary code and electric signals (e.g. 00101010110) that can be understood by computer hardware. There are many levels of abstraction in between, so programmers don't have to interact with details of the system that are not revelant to them (such as how the programming language works, or how memory gets allocated).\nSo far, in the solutions we wrote, we think in terms of steps: DoStep1, DoStep2, DoStep3 until we solve a problem. We're thinking in the Verbs that constitute a solution. Our abstractions are functions that do things to reach a solution. We can use a function without knowing how it works (think about console.log()) - the abstraction of that function hides the complexity of how console.log actually works.\nNow we will step into a new way of writing of abstractions - Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\n\nThe basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.\n\nOO overview\nDefining an object template (classes)\n\nIn OOP we create templates for objects that we will create. These are often called classes.\nCreating actual objects (instances)\n\nFrom a class we can create (or instantiate) an object. This process is called instantiation. \nSpecialist classes\n\n\nExercise: On a paper, let's model  our class - what classes do we have, what objects, what properties do they have, can we create any specialised classes?\n\nObject literals\nThere are several ways to create objects - we've already used one before: object literals.\nvar person = {}\nIn the example above an empty object is created. Let's create a more sophisticated object.\n``js\nvar person = {\n  name: ['Simon', 'Muong'],\n  age: 32,\n  gender: 'male',\n  interests: ['javascript', 'html'],\n  greeting: function() {\n    alert('Hi! I\\'m ' + this.name[0] + '.');\n  }\n};\n\nSo what is going on here? Well, an object is made up of multiple _properties_, each of which have a _name_ (e.g. `name` and `age` above), and a _value_ (e.g. `['Bob', 'Smith']` and `32`). Each name/value pair must be separated by a comma, and the name and value in each case are separated by a colon. The syntax always follows this pattern.\n\nThe value of an object property can be pretty much anything — in our person object we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are _data items_, and are referred to as the object's properties. The last two items are functions that allow the object to do something with that data, and are referred to as the object's `methods`.\n\n> Methods are functions that allow the object to do something with its data.\n\n> The `this` keyword refers to the context when the method is called. In this case, when calling `person.greeting()` the context is `person`, so `this` refers to that person object. `this` is a much more complicated and confusing topic in JavaScript but we will come back to it again and again.\n\nAn object like the one in our example is referred to as an object literal — we've **literally** written out the object contents as we've come to create it. This is in contrast to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at next.\n\n> Exercise: write this Person object that we just implemented. Add a `method` called `printBio` that prints the interests of that person.\n\n> Exercise: create another object for a different person with the same `methods` but different data (different name, interests etc...)\n\n## Constructor functions\n\n> Exercise: Let's create a function called `createPerson` that takes a `name` as a parameter and returns an object.\n\nSome programming languages have a `class` keyword that allows programmers to create that template of an Object. \nJavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\n\nLet's look at how `constructor functions` work.\n\n\n``js\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.greeting = function() {\n    alert('Hi! I am ' + this.name + '.');\n  };\n}\nThis is the template that defines what a Person should look like. Now let's create a specific object, an instance of Person.\n``js\nvar sally = new Person('Sally');\nconsole.log(sally); // { name: 'Sally': greeting:  }\nconsole.log(sally instanceof Person); // true\n```\nYou'll see that the this keyword is being used again here. What exactly is this? When a constructor function is called with the new operator, a new object is created (called an instance), and the this keyword is a reference to that object. In our example we add a property (name) and a method (greeting) to this. Now, whenever Person is instantiated, it returns an object with a name property and a greeting method.\nYou'll also notice that the constructor function take a parameter, name (which gets passed to Person in the example above). When Person is instantiated the name parameter is assigned to this.name (as well as being used to configure the greeting method).\n\nSome people argue that JavaScript is not a true object-oriented language — for example, it doesn't have a class statement for creating classes, unlike many OO languages. JavaScript, instead, uses special functions called constructor functions to define objects and their features. They are useful because you'll often come across situations in which you don't know how many objects you will be creating; constructors provide the means to create as many objects as you need in an effective way, attaching data and functions to them as required.\nExercise: Let's add another property to that Person called gender that will take either 'male' or 'female' as values (these will be passed as parameters same as name).\nExercise: add a method called displayInfo that will print the person's name with 'Mr' or 'Ms' depending on the gender of the Person.\n\nHomework\n\nFinish this tutorial from BBC - http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/topics/z7tp34j\nFinish this CodeAcademy course on OOP in JavaScript - https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-beginner-en-vj8Tr/0/1\nRead Chapter 4 - Functions from the book: JavaScript: The Good Parts\nRead Chapter 5 of Code Complete 2 (Design In Construction)\nRead Chapter 7 (High Quality Routines)\n[Optional] Read this chapter of Eloquent JavaScript - http://eloquentjavascript.net/1st_edition/chapter8.html (up to the exercises).

For example to create a string you can write\nvar myString = 'Hello';\n\nAnd to create an array:\nvar myArray = ['hello', 1, 2];\n\nAnd an object, just for fun:\nvar myObject = {\n  name: 'Daniel',\n  age: 10,\n  interests: ['JavaScript', 'Cycling']\n};\n\nThis is the best way to create new data, but it's helpful to know that you can also create new data using the new operator and a built in constructor function.\nFor example, you could also create a new string like this:\nvar myString = new String('Hello');\n\nOr an array:\nvar myArray = new Array(1,2,3);\n\n\nDo not actually create data using this approach in practice. These examples are for learning purposes only!\n\nString is a constructor function just like the constructor functions we learnt to write in the previous session, and myString is an instance of String. (Kinda cool how JavaScript is built on JavaScript, huh?!)\nWhen you check what a string looks like created in this way, things get a bit weird though:\nvar myString = new String('Hello');\nconsole.log(myString);\n\nWill log:\nString {\n  0: \"h\",\n  1: \"e\",\n  2: \"l\",\n  3: \"l\",\n  4: \"o\",\n  length: 5,\n  [[PrimitiveValue]]: \"hello\"\n}\n\nWhoa! What happened to my string?! Why does this happen? Why isn't myString just 'hello'?\nThe first reason is that, if you remember back to the previous session, constructor functions create objects. Calling new  always returns an object.\nThe second reason is that any objects a constructor creates can be given methods, and methods for built in data types turn out to be extremely useful.\n\nRecap: methods are functions that belong to an object\n\nWe can try calling some of the methods given to strings.\nmyString.toUpperCase(); // hello\nmyString.split(''); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\nmyString.endsWith('o'); // true\n\nYou might also have noticed that our instance of String also has a length property, so we can go ahead and find out the length of our string:\nmyString.length; // 5\n\nBefore we move onto the next section, just remember that the purpose of this lesson was to improve our understanding of how JavaScript work. You don't need to actually create data using new String() to get access to all the methods provided by String (JavaScript does this for you behind the scenes).\nExercises:\n\nCreate a string using literal syntax and call the .toUpperCase() method on it\nCreate an array and call the .push() method on it\nCreate a string using the built in String constructor function and note any differences from using literal syntax\nCall a method e.g. .toUpperCase() on a string you created using the String constructor function\n\nLearn about split and join\nInheritance using Constructor.prototype\nIn the previous lesson we learnt how to write methods like this:\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.greeting = function greeting() {\n    alert('Hello my name is ' + this.name);\n  }\n}\nUsing this approach, every time that Person is instantiated, a new greeting function is created. If you create a new Person() 100 times, 100 greeting functions will be created for each one. This seems wasteful considering all the greeting functions are exactly the same.\nOne way to solve this is using prototypal inheritance. That sounds a bit scary so let's take it a step at a time.\nWe can say that a property is inherited when it is passed down from a parent. For example, perhaps one of the properties your parents passed to you was being really good looking. You might say that it's a family trait.\nIn JavaScript, there are 2 ways that a new objects receives properties. The first is copying, the way we've being doing it so far: inside the constructor function properties are added to the new object (this) when it is created. The properties are inherited from the (parent) constructor function, but once the object has been created the constructor function cannot change it.\nprototype\nThe other way that objects can receive properties from their constructor function is by inheritance. This happens via the constructor function's prototype, which is an object containing hidden properties and methods.  \n\nExercise\nOpen up the console in your web browser and type in String.prototype. An object with will be returned. If you expand this object you'll see that it contains several hidden methods.\nYou can also search on the internet for \"String prototype\", \"Array prototype\" etc. and find documentation for the associated methods.\n\nWhen you create a new object, a hidden link is made between the new object and it's constructor function's prototype.\nWe can test that this link exists in our browser's console:\nfunction MyConstructor () {}\nvar myObj = new MyConstructor();\nObject.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true\n\nLet's add a method to our constructor function's prototype:\nMyConstructor.prototype.greeting = function () {\n  console.log('Hello');\n}\n\nThe greeting method will now be inherited by objects created with MyConstructor.\nvar myObj2 = new Constructor();\nmyObj2.greeting(); // Hello\n\nRemember that when objects are created a link between them and their constructor is created? Well, even though myObj was created before we added the greeting method, myObj is linked to MyConstructor.prototype, so it will inherit the newly created method as well.\nmyObj.greeting(); // Hello\n\nBoth myObj and myObj2 inherit properties from MyConstructor via prototypal inheritance.\nObject.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj2) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true\n\nThe prototype chain\nWhen you access a property of an object, JavaScript first checks if the object has such a property itself. If it does it will use that. If not, it will check the object's prototype.\nfunction Person (name, formal) {\n  this.name = name;\n  if (formal) {\n    this.greeting = function () {\n      console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nPerson.prototype.greeting = function () {\n  console.log('Hey, it\\'s ' + this.name);\n}\n\nvar alice = new Person('Alice');\n// No greeting method on alice\nconsole.log(alice); // { name: 'Alice' }\nalice.greeting(); // Hey it's Alice\n\nvar bob = new Person('Bob', true);\n// bob was instantiated with a greeting method\nconsole.log(alice); // { name: 'Bob', greeting: function() {} }\nbob.greeting(); // Hello, my name is Bob\n\nArray methods and callbacks\nThe most useful built in methods in JavaScript are the Array.prototype methods. Every array has access to these methods (because Arrays are created by the Array constructor function they inherit the the properties of Array.prototype).\nOf particular use are the Array methods that enable you to iterate over an array. We've covered iteration already when we learnt how to use for loops. Well, I have some amazing news for you - you will probably never need to write a for loop again!\nLet's take a look at Array.prototype.forEach first. This is pretty much a straight replacement for for loops.\nvar myArr = [1,2,3];\n\nmyArr.forEach(function (item) {\n  console.log(item);\n});\n\n// 1\n// 2\n// 3\n\nOOOOF! Wasn't that glorious?! Much nicer than writing a for loop! So how exactly does this work? forEach iterates over each item the array. For each item is calls a function - the one that was provided as an parameter to forEach.\nCallback functions\nFunctions that are provided as parameters to another function are called callback functions. Often we will write these functions inside the function call like did in the forEach example, but we can also pass in reference to an already defined function:\nfunction callback(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n}\n\nmyArr.forEach(callback);\n\nWhether you define your function beforehand or write it straight into the function call will depend on whether you intend on re-using that callback again.\nMore array methods\nPreviously we've used for loops to create new versions of an array doing something like this:\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar newArr = [];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i \nThere are several methods on Array.prototype that can be used for this sort of task.\nThe most popular method is .map(), which does the following:\n\niterates over the array it is called on\ncalls a callback function on every iteration\npasses in the current array item and its index to the callback function\nuses the returned value from the callback function to populate a new array\nreturns the new array\n\nThat sounds like a lot but once you use .map() a few times it'll begin to feel more intuitive. Let's try it and see if we can refactor the for loop example:\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar newArr = arr.map(function (num) {\n  return num + 1\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [2,3,4]\n\nAnother useful array method is .filter(). It works in a similar way to map except that rather than return a value in the callback function, you return true or false depending on whether you want the current item to be included in the new array. Returning true means that you want to keep the item, returning false means it should be omitted.\nLet's create a new array with only numbers greater than 5:\nvar arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];\nvar newArr = arr.filter(function (num) {\n  return arr > 5\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [5,6,7,8,9]\n\n\nRemember: Most array methods do not change the current array, they return a new array. Check the MDN documentation for the array method if you are not sure about this.\n\nChaining methods\nIf we want to apply more than one array method to an array we might try something like this, creating an intermediate variable after each transformation.\nvar arr = [1,2,3];\nvar arrMapped = arr.map(function (num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nvar arrFiltered = newArr.filter(function (num) {\n  return num > 5;\n});\n\nThis can get quite awkward though, especially when you have to think of a variable name for each stage. Thankfully there is a much simpler way. We can chain methods together:\nvar newArr = [1,2,3]\n  .map(function (num) {\n    return num + 1;\n  });\n  .filter(function (num) {\n    return num > 5;\n  });\n\nThere's nothing magical happening here. This works because:\n\nthe array methods are returning new arrays\nevery array has access to all the array methods on Array.prototype\n\nAs soon as an array is returned by an array method we can call another array method on the return value.\n\nExercise\nTransform the following array [4,5,3,6,7,8,9,1,2] by 1) sorting it, 2) doubling each number, and 3) filtering numbers less than 10\nWrite named functions that can be used as callbacks.\n\nIntro to ES6\nECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces new syntax for writing complex applications including classes and modules and other features.\nconst and let\non JS Bin, let's write this simple code snippet\n``js\nfunction sayGreeting(name, gender) {\n    var greeting = 'Hello';\n    var nameWithTitle;\n    if (gender === 'female') {\n        nameWithTitle = 'Ms. ' + name;\n    } else {\n        nameWithTitle = 'Mr. ' + name;\n    }\n    return greeting + name;\n}\n// sayGreeting('Rares', 'male') should return 'Hello Mr. Rares'\n// sayGreeting('Irina', 'female') should return ' Hello Ms. Irina'\n> Exercise: Let's update this code to use `let` and `const` instead of `var`\n\n## Template literals\n\n> Exercise: We do a lot of string concatenation in JavaScript - ES6 introduces a more elegant way of accomplishing the same. Let's try it.\n\n## Arrow functions\n> Exercise: ES6 also has a new way of declaring functions. Let's see how it works.\n\n> Exercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks if gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make the code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\n## More ES6\nThere are so many features in ES6. They're mostly what we call `syntax sugar`. They don't provide new functionality, but new (more elegant) ways of accomplishing the same tasks.\n\nSince not all ES6 features are supported in all browsers, many developers and projects use what is called `Transpilation` - a process that transpiles/translates ES6 code to ES5 syntax that is supported by all browsers.\n\nOn Node, most ES6 features are now natively supported in Node 8.\n\n> From now on, we expect you to use ES6 syntax in your assignments and the code you write.\n\n# TDD again\n\n> Exercise: Clone the repo https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\n\n> Let's talk about TDD again?\n> 1. Why do we do TDD\n> 2. How do we run the tests? Read some of the tests\n> 3. Notice we're separating our tests from our code now. We are making use of **modules**\n> 4. Also notice the **coverage**\n\n## How do modules work?\n\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.\n\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called *modules*. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.\n\n## Creating modules, exporting code\n\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:\n\n```js\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it, and this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are importing. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will import a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our program.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in our own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files \"*.test.js\".\n\nResources\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance\nhttp://sporto.github.io/blog/2013/02/22/a-plain-english-guide-to-javascript-prototypes/\nhttps://johnresig.com/apps/learn/#64\nArray Methods\nString Methods\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\nHomework\n\nWatch Wes Bos videos about ES6 - https://es6.io/ (if you don't have access, let us know)\n\nFork, Clone and Do the exercises in this repo - https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nFinish this tutorial about Chrome Dev Tools(https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/)\n\n"},"js-core-2/lesson7.html":{"url":"js-core-2/lesson7.html","title":"Week 11 - More Objects and core JS","keywords":"","body":" \nJavaScript Core 7\n What we will learn today?\n\nDebugging and Chrome Dev Tools (quick recap)\nObjects Again\nValue Vs reference types\nScope\nHigher Order Functions\n\n\nDebugging\n\nExercise: Trace some code on paper\n\nObjects Again\nObjects vs Arrays\nA data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on.\nWe have been dealing mainly with two types of data structures so far - Arrays and Objects.\nWhen we are you solving a problem, one of your main decisions as a developer is to choose the data structures you will use to solve it. So when do you use an Array and when do you use an Object.\n\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\"\nLinus Torvalds\nLet's talk about the differences between Arrays and Objects - when can you use or the other. As a general rule of thumb:\n\n\nDoes the order of data matter? Then use Arrays.\nCan the data be organised by a label? Then use Objects.\n\n\nExercise: Let's say we're writing a program to model and display a Newspaper: what data structure would you use to model the different sections of the newspaper (sports, politics etc..)? Write a data structure in JavaScript to represent your newspaper\nExercise: Now if we're going to model a Book with different chapters - what data strucuture would we use?\nExercise: Think of a scenario where we might need to combine both?\n\nObject Exercises\n\nExercise\nWrite a function \"printProperties\" that takes an object and prints its properties\n\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nprintProperties(student);\n// Output in this case should be name, age, interests\n\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called hasProperty that takes an object and a property. The function should return true if the property exists, false if it doesn't\n\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nhasProperty(student, 'age'); // should return true\nhasProperty(student, 'job'); // should return false\n\n\nExercise: compare that to how you find an element in array?\nExercise\nWrite a function called ownProperty that takes an object which has a prototype, and a field. The function should return true only if the property exists on the object (and not it's prototype)\n```js\nvar person = {\n    name: \"Simon\"\n}\n\nvar student = {\n    interests: [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n}\nstudent.proto = person // this is setting the prototype of student to be person\nownProperty(student, \"name\") // should return false\nownProperty(student, \"interests\") // should return true\n\n>Exercise\n>Write a function called printObject that takes an object and iterates through all its properties and prints a string formatted property: value\n>Bonus points if you can format the list of interests properly\n\n```js\nvar student = {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nprintObject(student); //output: \"name is Simon, age is 21, interests are [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called \"printArray\" that use the previous function \"printObject\". It should loop through the array of students and print each item\n\nvar students = [{\n    name: \"Etza\",\n    age: \"21\",\n    interests : [\"javascript\", \"css\"]\n}, {\n    name: 'Mohamed',\n    age: 22,\n    interests: [\"javascript\", \"c#\"]\n}];\n\nprintArray(student);\n// output:\n// \"name is Simon, age is 21, interests are [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\"\n// \"name is Mohamed, age is 22, interests are [\"javascript\", \"c#\"]\"\n\nMore advanced working with objects\nLet's say you have the following object in javascript, where each key/property is the type of note (£5, £10 and £20 note), and the value is the number of notes in the wallet.\nvar wallet = {\n  5: 3,\n  10: 7,\n  20: 2\n}\n\n\nExercise\nWrite a function that takes in the wallet as an argument, and returns the total money in the wallet.\n\nNext you're given another wallet, and it's put in an array with the first:\nvar walletA = { // our original wallet\n  5: 3,\n  10: 7,\n  20: 2\n}\n\nvar walletB = {\n  5: 6,\n  10: 0,\n  20: 1\n}\n\nvar wallets = [walletA, walletB]\n\n\nExercises\n\nWrite a function - sumWallets - that takes the array wallets and returns the total amount of money for all of the wallets.\n\nWrite another function - combineWallets - that takes the array of wallets and combines all of the notes in each of them, returning a single wallet with all of the other wallets' notes.\n\nSee if you can write a function - sumDynamicWallet - that will sum up and return the total amount in a single wallet, but it could have any number of different notes inside it (£7 note or a £13 or any other number).\n\nSee if you can write a function that takes in any number of wallets, which could contain any denomination/type of notes inside them (each being different). Tip: have a think about if you could re-use a function from a previous example...\n\n\n\nValue vs Reference Types\nA variable can hold two types of values: primitives (value types) and reference types.\nThe distinction between them is very important and will be a fundamental addition\nto your JavaScript arsenal.\nPrimitives are:\n\nstring (example: John Doe)\nnumber (example: 100)\nboolean (example: true or false)\n\nReference types are:\n\nObjects (example: {greeting: \"hello\"})\nArrays (example: [1,2,3])\nFunctions (example: function doNothing() { })\n\nVariables can only hold a few bytes of data. \nBecause primitives have fixed sizes, when you assign a primitive to a variable, \nit will hold the actual value of the primitive (hence the name \"value type\").\nBut reference types can have practically infinite sizes, so when you assign a reference type \nto a variable, that variable will hold a reference to it only: an identifier which will tell our program\nwhere to look for that object in memory.\n\nPass by value / reference\nConsider the example below.\n``js\nfunction addFive(value) {\n    value = value + 5;\n}\nvar ten = 10;\naddFive(ten);\nconsole.log(ten);\n\nWe have a function that accepts a value as an argument. The function then adds five to the\nargument and logs the value.\nAfter invoking the function with the variable `ten`, the variable is logged.\n\nWhat will be the values logged?\nAnswer: 10 (not 15)\n\nExplanation:\nIn JavaScript, variables are always passed to function by value. That means only the value\nthe variables was holding is passed to the function, and not a reference to the variable's\nlocation in memory. That means that inside a function call, any changes we make to its\narguments will only apply inside the function (as seen in the previous example).\n\n**Be careful though**, as the value of an argument might be a reference to a JavaScript\nobject, in which case, changing a property on that object will also reflect everywhere\nelse we use a reference to that object.\n\nFor example:\n\n``js\n\nfunction a(primitive, object) {\n    primitive = primitive + 5;\n    object.greeting = \"how are you?\";\n    object = {\n      greeting: \"holla!\"  \n    };\n}\nvar primitive = 10;\nvar object = {\n  greeting: 'hello'  \n};\na(primitive, object);\nconsole.log(primitive); // 10\nconsole.log(object.greeting); // \"how are you?\"\n\nLet's look at the illustrations here: http://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-primitive-vs-reference-values/ to understand this behavior better\nExercise\n\nOpen up the CodePen here\nCreate a new index.html and main.js file\nLink the main.js from the index.html so that it runs in the browser\nCopy the exercises from the CodePen above into main.js and follow the instructions in the comments\n\n\nScope\nBefore we get into what scope is, let's try a little exercise.\nOpen up jsbin and write the following:\nfunction () {\n    var name = \"hello\";\n}\nconsole.log(name);\n\n\nWhat do you think the first console.log will print?\n\nvar hello = \"outer\";\nfunction() {\n    var hello = \"inner\";\n    console.log(hello);\n}\n\n\nWhat do you think calling the function will print?\n\nLet's see another example\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        console.log(a);\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis should work fine, and the console should print 10. But what if we swap the positions of var a and the console.log()?\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n\n    var secondFunction = function() {\n        var a = 10;\n    }\n\n    secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that the problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the code order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction, where a is assigned:\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n\nvar secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n}\n\nconsole.log(a);\n\nsecondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the console.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the error. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following diagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has access to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above' it, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have access to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So each function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's own, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child scope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has 'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\nvar test = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n    var test = \"I'm local\";\n    console.log (test);     \n}\n\ntestScope();           // output: I'm local\n\nconsole.log(test);     // output: I'm global\n\n\nExercise\n\nContinue working on your main.js from your previous exercises\nCopy the exercises from this CodePen\nRemember to comment/uncomment each set once you're done with them\n\n\nResources\n\nObjects vs Arrays - https://www.metaltoad.com/blog/javascript-understanding-objects-vs-arrays-and-when-use-them-part-1\nJavaScript Arrays and Objects Are Just Like Books and Newspapers https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-arrays-and-objects-are-just-like-books-and-newspapers-6e1cbd8a1746\n\nHomework\n\nCreate an account on CodeWars and do at least 15 challenges.\nSign up for the JavaScript 30 course and do at least 2 project.

Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example.  A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS files, images, maybe some javascript files.

It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to build your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation for becoming a Node.js developer.\nIn the next steps, we will building a CMS (Content Management System) - a system to write, publish and save blog posts. Even though we could use core libraries like http to build this system, this becomes very complicated and non-maintainable very quickly. That is why we use frameworks like Express.\nBefore you Start\nFork the repository https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/express-workshop\n$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/express-workshop\nStep 1 - Setting up your project\nWhen creating a Node.js project, you will be installing a lot of different things along the way. If you want to share your project with others, you need to have a list of the things you installed, so that other people know what to install in order to run the project.\nIn Node.js, this 'list' file is called a package.json. The 'things you've installed' are referred to as dependencies. Creating this file is the first step in setting up your Node.js project. \n1. Make a package.json file\nLet's start by creating the package.json file. We can add things to it as the project grows. The package.json file is easy to create from the command line. Type the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the package.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from (index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version, description, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license - do you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in your project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called Passport.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is a type of file for structuring data in a readable way. It is also a really popular format for sending data across the web.\nJSON is a string representation of a Javascript object. JSON objects convert really easily to Javascript objects, and vice versa, with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().\n``js\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"mobile\",\n      \"number\": \"123 456-7890\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n\n# Step 2 - Installing Express\n\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're going to use the **[Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/)** to download it using the **`npm install`** command.\n\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.  There are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as \"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects. \n\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the `package.json` to add Express as a dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know to install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding **`--save`** to the end of your command.\n\nRun the following command in your terminal:\n\n`$ npm install express --save`\n\nExpress should now be installed. Check your `package.json` file to make sure it has been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\n![package.json screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10683087/16382664/be35f0b4-3c79-11e6-82b6-ae9e4a037c3f.png)\n\n# Step 3 - Building the server\n\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build a server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but Express gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n\n\n## 1. Create a `server.js` file\n\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called `server.js`. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n\n## 2. `require` the `express` library\n\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included in this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when you want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you `require` it.\n\nTo import Express, write the following inside `server.js`:\n\n```js\nconst express = require('express');\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of var.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This will create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think of a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via that door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments: a port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is running. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the Express documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as our callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen method:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!');\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in the terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the server file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\n$ node server.js\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to control the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes the handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives requests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends the response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what to send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to define a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint at which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step), and the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple \"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\n Here, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone tries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You can write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler function. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal to see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that, we're going to use the Express send() method. This will update the response object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your new changes.\n$ node server.js\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to http://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser, congratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from the / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different responses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example: /chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a request.\nWhat is URL?\n \n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember the app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat this method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function (req, res) {\n    res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the endpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back a whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want your server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do something different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in middleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more about it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The express.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of code above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If you see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET as a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT is for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead of GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your blogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor.  If you have a look, you should see this:\n\n    \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n    \n    Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.  \nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using whatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint.  In our case it's /create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what happens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a stream.  Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket.  Your job is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to collect the stream of data properly.  But luckily for us, Express handles all of that stuff under the hood.  \n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through on the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get('/hello-world', function (req, res) {\n    res.send('Hello there!');\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST request not a GET.  What do you think you would need to do differently?  Experiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am /create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.  Normally you would extract it using req.body.  Try to console.log req.body now.\nGetting undefined?  Not to worry, that's normal.  When data has been POSTed to the server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access the data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function.  Something that can get extract the contents out of the special FormData object.  For this we will use express-formidable.  express-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form data from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly install it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code.  You can't use dashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require('express-formidable');\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and app.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console.  The key should be blogpost, just like the name attribute in the form on the HTML page.  The value of blogpost will be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file (after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on the Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit of a shame.  Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The format is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in chronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on your computer's hard drive.  To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module: fs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in Express middleware functions.  Only difference is that where you need to have installed Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules come automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile('path/to/file', yourData, function (error) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to write to.  If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you.  But we already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile.  The way to use fs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile('path/to/file', function (error, file) {\n    // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.  That argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file.  Make sure you've required the fs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + '/data/posts.json', function (error, file) {\n\n    console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working directory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called a buffer.  To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file to a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now.  If we want to access the blog post message inside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data inside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.  You now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive!  Work with your partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your own.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its contents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it.  Chances are you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new one, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile() to prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.  JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript Date.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server.  Time to get them and display them on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code in there.  Don't worry about what all the code means, just know that it's responsible for sending a request to GET old blog posts and display them on the page underneath \"Recent Posts\".\nscript.js is trying to load existing posts by making a GET request. Look inside script.js and see if you can find any useful endpoints.\nYour script.js file will want to receive the JSON containing your blog posts.  Your job is to make that happen!\nExpress has a handy method called res.sendFile() that makes it easy to send files back to the client.  Feel free to use this with your JSON.\nIf all goes well, you should have a fully functional CMS!\nGroup Research Topics\n\nSecurity: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)\nPerformance: Request lifecycle (from browser to server and back), Performance considerations and optimisations\nHTTP and REST: (headers, status codes, Cookies, REST)\nNode internals: Node event loop, Node core modules, async/sync (non-blocking operations)\n\nThe research will be on a Github repo. One member of the group will be responsible of creating a repo, the others will fork it and create Pull Requests for it (that the main repo's owner will have to review and merge).\nWe expect each repo to have commits from each member of the group\nHomework\n\nFinish the tasks from the workshop\nTry adding an /about route to your app to serve some HTML. How is this different from using express's static middleware?

Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder. NodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nWebsites - a small detour\nWhat is wrong with this website?  \nIs this one any better?  \nThe final view is here  \nWhat was missing in the first example? \n   \nSo what is the point of all these?  \n   \nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate code (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache, and EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the templating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project:\nnpm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app \napp.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));\napp.set('view engine', 'handlebars');\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you find it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    res.render('index');\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint we created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we did with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information? Try to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any easier? \n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading text shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to different pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior as the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout (views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve static files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the routes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\n app.get('/', function (req, res) {\n     res.render('index', {\n         title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead \n     });\n });\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the template\n \n     \n         \n             \n             \n             \n             A modern Website built in Node\n         \n     \n \n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was provided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates. (Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and move it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the original menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim through the express-handlebars and handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get('/', function (req, res) {\n    const filePath = __dirname + '/data/posts.json';\n    const callbackFunction = function(error, file) {\n        // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n        const fileData = file.toString();\n        // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n        const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n        // send the json to the Template to render\n        res.render('index', {\n          title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead\n          posts: postsJson\n        });\n    };\n    fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We can pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and .filter.\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {\n    console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function( num ) {console.log(num);} function as an argument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed asynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look at both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback){\n    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );\n}\n\nfunction logRandom(){\n    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);\n    console.log( value );\n    return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the Node code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that doesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add js\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the anonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead. (Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a requirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to retrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url that we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make another API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener('load', function() {\n    var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n        var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {\n            // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n\n        });\n        oReq3.open('GET', url); // 3. third url for branch info\n        oReq3.send();\n    });\n    oReq.open('GET', url); // 2. second url for branches\n    oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open('GET', url); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape }) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to communicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day: Github API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important information. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different ways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a Mobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs - What is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to consume through the url /api/get-posts.\nHint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a way (an architecture) for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one fundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the URL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a Resource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful architecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA - What is a REST API (up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia shows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your endpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations performed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers, hardware, or infrastructure.\n\nGo to https://signup.heroku.com/ and signup for an account\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a valid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and use it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on heroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your express-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v, you should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to register. \n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a git remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few commands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to https://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes well, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check\nhttps://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up\nHomework\n\nDeploy to Heroku if you haven't yet\nAdd a route posts/:postid that displays a specific post - Read about route parameters on Express documentation\nWhen the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your route.\nAmend your JSON structure to have a postId that you can use it to identify which post we want to display.\n\n\nImplement the Admin page. \nWrite a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON file (use the helper functions we added under helpers/savePost)\nMake an AJAX call from the front end (the admin page) to your new endpoint.\nYou might need to use formidable or body-parser middleware to get the data on the server.\n\n\nConsume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to display their latest blog posts. You can display the posts on any page that you see suitable (or add a new page).\nSecure the Admin page so that it's only visible if a certain query parameter is provided\nCan you go a bit further with adding proper security?

Click Create\ntry to add an item to the table in the console. Use Items -> Create Item. How to add content? \ntry to add few more posts\n\nExercise - Read posts from DynamoDB\nWe want to change the code in our app inside the \\ to read posts from DynamoDB. How do we do that? \nWe are going to use AWS SDK for this. \n\nrun npm install --save aws-sdk\nload credentials - create in the root of the project a file called config.jsonadd your access and secret keys {\n     \"accessKeyId\": \"YOUR_ACCESS_KEY\",\n     \"secretAccessKey\": \"YOUR_SECRET_KEY\",\n     \"region\": \"eu-west-1\",\n     \"endpoint\": \"https://dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\"\n }\n\n\nadd AWS to the project\n // Load the SDK for JavaScript\n const AWS = require('aws-sdk');\n\n // Load credentials and set region from JSON file\n AWS.config.loadFromPath('./config.json');\n\n\nnow we need to change the route to the root of our project to get the data from Dynamo\n app.get('/', function (req, res) {\n\n     var docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();\n\n     var params = {\n         TableName: \"cyf-student-posts\",\n         ProjectionExpression: \"title, summary, content\",\n     };\n\n     console.log(\"Scanning posts table.\");\n     docClient.scan(params, onScan);\n\n     function onScan(err, data) {\n         if (err) {\n             console.error(\"Unable to scan the table.

If not, why not? How can it be done differently? \nExercise - Write posts to DynamoDB\nIf you have not finished, you can use the Express app and checkout the commit: 2e4722ac2828da8f6b00d9e63727e9116a08efbdWe now have to find a way to write our new posts from the app to the DynamoDB. How can we do that? What needs to be changed? \n\nwe need to change the POST behaviour to the /admin endpoint\nremove the code from this route and just add console.log(req.body). Try it out\nadd to the route \n```js\napp.post('/admin', function (req, res) {\n // Create the DynamoDB service object\n var docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();\n var params = {\n TableName: 'cyf-student-posts',\n Item:{\n     'title' : req.body.title,\n     'summary' : req.body.summary,\n     'content' : req.body.contents,\n }\n };\n // Call DynamoDB to add the item to the table\n console.log(\"Adding a new item...\");\n docClient.put(params, function(err, data) {\n if (err) {\n     console.error(\"Unable to add item. Error JSON:\", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));\n } else {\n     console.log(\"Added item:\", JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));\n }\n });\n\n\n});\n1. change `add-posts.js` behaviour to redirect to the main page, since we don't really wait for any reply from the server\n\n# Express Generator\n\nLink to the tutorial https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html\n\n# Middleware\nMiddleware functions are functions that have access to the request object, `req`, the response object, `res`, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`.\n\nMiddleware functions can perform the following tasks:\n\n- Execute any code\n- Make changes to the request and the response objects\n- End the request-response cycle\n- Call the next middleware function in the stack\n\n> **Exercise**: We've already used one built-in middleware in our app - what was it?\n\n## Setup an error handler\nYou define error-handling middleware in the same way as other middleware, except with four arguments instead of three; specifically with the signature (err, req, res, next):\n\n```js\napp.use(function (err, req, res, next) {\n  console.error(err.stack)\n  res.status(500).send('Something broke!')\n})\nLet's write a custom middleware\nvar myLogger = function (req, res, next) {\n  console.log('LOGGED')\n  next()\n}\n\napp.use(myLogger)\n\n\nExercise: Follow the tutorial for writing requestTime at https://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html and add it to your own application\n\nHomework\nYou can use this as a starting point - https://github.com/Michael-Antczak/Express-workshop-3\n\nExercise - Handle \"Page Not Found\"\nWalk through the code again and make sure you understand what it does\nif you have time you can try to expand on the My CV project that we worked on today:\n a) sort posts alphabetically\n b) when the new post is added to the database, send an email to yourself about that (edited)\n\n"},"node-db/lesson4.html":{"url":"node-db/lesson4.html","title":"Week 15 - MongoDB","keywords":"","body":" \nNode 4\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nDatabases overview\nMongoDB\nMongo Shell\nMongo with Node\n\n\nBefore we start\nDownload and install MongoDb from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community .\nFollow the instructions for your platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal. Run mongod - this will start MongoDB then run mongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal) - run the command version() and you should get the version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database?\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up little space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes your information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without corrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days. Relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used for all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of MongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with predefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB stores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about students participating in a course\n\n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two rows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the document is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also allows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the format - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile\nThe shell should respond with switched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily exist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be created and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection.\nMake sure you're using the profile database. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors: ['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name: 'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3 documents.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the language used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the method db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a first parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we want back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: 'Ethiopia' }, { name: 1 })\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] })\n and\n db.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors: ['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] })\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is \"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({ \n    $and: [\n        { name: 'Mohamed'}, \n        { country: 'Sudan'}\n    ]\n})\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise:\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the $in operator and use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other Comparison Query Operators and the Logical Query Operators and use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON documents. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo databases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using query operators to search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers for most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS applications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and patterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop. run npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload - Go to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver\nnpm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the students that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the module\nconst MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get('/students', (req, res) => {\n    const mongoConnection = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/profile';\n\n    MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n        const cursor = db.collection('students').find({});\n        cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n            db.close();\n            res.json(students);\n        });\n    });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the documents we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n  Connection String documentation - The connection string follows this format: mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]] - what parts do you have in our connection string right now?\n\n\nExercise\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the json file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did with students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection called posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very similar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint).\nGo to http://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a document in the database (either check the documentation for update or use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you will encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but we deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the database.\n\n\nExercise Part 2: Refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have a lot of duplicate code - both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the same call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that something (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to eliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if the connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing possibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it once and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for /api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle - the route handlers have multiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data then sending it back as a response.\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the functions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and require.\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember the steps, refresh your memory from the previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working properly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku server, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other services on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy to scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard https://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons, search for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this screen - click on Provision.\n\n\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources - you can click on it and it will take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the a variable called MongoDB_URI - that is the connection string for the MongoDB instance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user environment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of our application based on the environment where it's running - so for instance, when we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but on Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other typical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything that is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive information in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to configure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before - what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku, but fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment variable provided.\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks - https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database\nDatabases and Collections https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell \nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables - https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"node-db/lesson5.html":{"url":"node-db/lesson5.html","title":"Week 16 - Mongoose","keywords":"","body":"\nNode 5\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nMongoose\nModelling Data\nSaving Data with HTML forms\nA note on Progressive Enhancement\n\n\nModelling Relationships\nDebugging NodeJS\n\n\nMongoose\nMongoose is a library that allow you to model your application data using a schema. It uses type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more to help you manage your data.\nWhat is a Schema?\nA \"schema\" is like a blueprint for your data. In a Relational Database, it will define what tables exist in the database, what columns they contain, and what type of data, like numbers or strings, each column can accept.\nDatabases like MongoDB are said to be schema-less. If we have a collection called persons, a document may look like this:\n{\n    name: \"Anthony\",\n    age: 21,\n    nationality: \"Kenya\"\n}\n\nWe can add a document to the personss collection with a new field: profession. Now we have two documents like this:\n[{\n    name: \"Anthony\",\n    age: 21,\n    nationality: \"Kenya\"\n}, {\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: 23,\n    nationality: \"South Africa\",\n    profession: \"Software Engineer\"\n}]\n\nOne document has the field profession while the other does not. When we write our app to read the database, it will need to check if the profession field exists on a document before trying to use it.\nIn a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), we can define the schema (or structure) of our documents and the database will ensure every document has the same structure.\nIn the schema, we would tell the database what to do if a document doesn't have a profession value. For instance, we could tell it to default to some value (student) or leave it null. We can also tell it what type it should be (eg - integer or string).\nWith a schema, our application can be certain that every document it retrieves from the database will have the same structure. There are pros and cons to using databases with and without schemas.\n\nOne of the great benefits of these dynamic objects is that schema migrations become very easy. With a traditional RDBMS, releases of code might contain data migration scripts. Further, each release should have a reverse migration script in case a rollback is necessary. ALTER TABLE operations can be very slow and result in scheduled downtime.\nWith a schemaless database, 90% of the time adjustments to the database become transparent and automatic. For example, if we wish to add GPA to the student objects, we add the attribute, resave, and all is well – if we look up an existing student and reference GPA, we just get back null. Further, if we roll back our code, the new GPA fields in the existing objects are unlikely to cause problems if our code was well written.\n\nMongoose Schema\nMongoDB is a schema-less database, which makes it easy to use without any configuration. But there is a benefit to having a schema at the Application level. For example, with a schema we can perform validation when we are saving data to the database.\nAt the moment, there is nothing stopping us from saving a person document like this:\n{\n    name: \"Simon\",\n    age: \"twenty three\"\n}\n\n\nGroup discussion: What problems might arise from entering the age as a string instead of an integer?\n\nMongoose is a library that provides an easier interface to interact with MongoDB. It also helps us implement a Schema to provide validation to our database, so that we can make sure the data we are entering matches our expectations.\nExercise\nLet's use Mongoose for the project we've built so far.\n\nnpm install --save mongoose\nAdd a Schema for our Models\nCreate a file, Post.js under /models/Post.js\nDefine the Schema for a post document in this file.\n\n\n\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst { Schema } = mongoose;\n\nconst schema = new Schema({\n    title: String,\n    contents: String,\n    summary: String\n});\n\nconst Post = mongoose.model('posts', schema);\n\nmodule.exports = Post;\n\n\nTo use the Model in our application, require the Post.js schema file and mongoose at the top of your file:\n\n\n// Top of your file\nconst mongoConnection = process.env.MONGODB_URI || 'mongodb://localhost:27017/profile';\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst Post = require('../models/Post');\n\n\nFind the code where you connected to the database to retrieve the posts and change it to:\n\nmongoose.connect(mongoConnection);\nPost.find({}, callback);\n// callback is a function that takes an error as first argument and the posts as the second argument\n\nForm Data - POST\n\nDiscussion: What are the HTTP verbs? Which verbs are used to save data?\n\nLet's update the HTML form on our admin page to be able to save new Posts.\n\nOpen the admin.handlebars file. Remove or comment the script at the end of the file:\n \n\nFind the  tag. Add the action and method attributes. It should look like this:\n \n\nWe also need to add a name attribute to our form input fields. For example, the title will look like this:\n \n Add a name attribute to the contents and summary input fields.\n\nOpen the Developer tools. Try to save a Post and see what happens.\n\nDiscussion: The browser is trying to perform a POST to /save-post. What HTTP status code is returned? What does it mean?\n\n\nCreate the endpoint /save-post to handle this request.\n We will use a package called express-formidable to handle the form requests. Let's start by installing it:\n npm install --save express-formidable\n Add these two lines to the top of the siteController:\n const formidable = require('express-formidable');\n router.use(formidable());\n\n Then define the route:\n router.post('/save-post', (req, res) => {\n   console.log(req.fields); // contains non-file fields\n   // req.files will contain files (if you upload images for example)\n });\n\n Now, if you save the form, our endpoint should log to the console an object containing the data you submitted.\n\nLet's save the data to MongoDB. We will use our Mongoose Post model.\n // require the model in the top of the file\n router.post('/save-post', (req, res) => {\n   console.log(req.fields); // contains non-file fields\n   const callback = (error, post) => {\n       // handle any errors which might ocur\n       if(error) {\n           console.error(error);\n           return res.redirect('/error');\n       }\n\n       console.log('post saved successfully', post);\n       res.redirect('/');\n   }\n\n   mongoose.connect(mongoConnection);\n   // This is using the Model to create an object\n   // based on the fields submitted from the form\n   const newPost = new Post(req.fields);\n   newPost.save(callback);\n });\n\n\n\nMongoose Validation\nYou can still save a Post without having any content, summary or title. Let's fix that:\nExercise: Make Title mandatory\nUpdate the Mongoose Model for Posts:\nconst schema = new Schema({\n    title: {\n        type: String,\n        required: true\n    },\n    contents: String,\n    summary: String\n});\n\nTry to save a post without a title and look at what happens:\n\nWhat is the result?\nHow is the error handled? It redirects to /error if an error is returned (the first argument to the callback is an error)\nHappy Path\n\n\nMake the contents and summary fields required.\n\nForm Data - Using AJAX\nNow let's go to admin.handlebars and uncomment or add the script at the end of file\n\nOpen the Developer Tools and notice what happens.\n\nWhat is happening when you click on Send.\n\nExercise:\n\nUpdate your POST /posts endpoint in apiController to use Mongoose\nDon't forget to require the modules that you need\n\n\n\nrouter.post('/posts', (req, res, next) => {\n  const callback = (error, post) => {\n      if(error) {\n          console.error(error.toString());\n          return res.sendStatus(500);\n      }\n\n      console.log('post saved successfully', post);\n      res.send(post);\n  }\n\n  mongoose.connect(mongoConnection);\n  // we can access req.body because we're using body-parser middleware\n  const newPost = new Post(req.body);\n  newPost.save(callback);\n});\n\n\nNotice how we're not rendering a view - we are just returning an HTTP response. Why is that?\n\nNote on Progressive Enhancement\nGo to Chrome Developer tools and Disable JavaScript. Does our Save Post functionality still work?\n\nProgressive Enhancement is a powerful methodology that allows Web developers to concentrate on building the best possible websites while balancing the issues inherent in those websites being accessed by multiple unknown user-agents. Progressive Enhancement (PE) is the principle of starting with a rock-solid foundation and then adding enhancements to it if you know certain visiting user-agents can handle the improved experience.\n\nmodelling Data\nWhat if we want to add a comments sections to our Posts.\n\nWhat are ways to model that data?\nWhat if each Post has one Comment only\nWhat if each Post has more than one Comment\nWhat if we need to have more information about the comment (data added, and user)\n\nEmbedded documents\nWith MongoDB, you can take advantage of MongoDB rich documents to embed related data in a single structure or documents.\n\nReferencing documents\nAnother way of modelling data, is to use Reference documents.\n\n\nReferences provides more flexibility than embedding. However, client-side applications must issue follow-up queries to resolve the references. In other words, normalized data models can require more round trips to the server.\n\nDiscussion: What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of the approach?\nReading\nLet's read this blog post togetherhttps://alexanderzeitler.com/articles/mongoose-referencing-schema-in-properties-and-arrays/\nExercise: Data modelling\nRequirements: We're building a System for a Hospital. We want to keep track of Doctors and their Appointments with Patients. We need to have the basic information about the doctor (name, contact information and address), the patients (name, age, contact information). Each appointment will have a date, notes from the doctor and a list of prescriptions. A patient is assigned one doctor, and all the appointments will be with the same doctor. A doctor can have up to 20 patients.\n\nWhat collections do we need in our database\nWrite a document representing a Patient. How will it look like?\nWhat will the other collections (if any) contain?\nStretch: What if each prescription has one or more Medicines and we want to keep information about the Medicine including its price.\n\nExercise: Adding comments\nIn the view single post view, add this form\n \n    \n    Add Comment\n\n\n\nNotice that the form does not an action attribute - what does that mean? Open the Developer tools and see what happens when you click the button\n\nUpdate the Post model to have an array of Comments\ncomments: [{\n    content: String\n}]\n\nExercise:\n\nAdd a route that handles the data being sent by the Client and saves it to the database\nUse the technique using findById described in this documentation entry\nAlso look at the documentation of $push to know how to add to an array https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/push/#up._S_push\n\n\nAre there more way we could have modeled our comments?\n\nResources\nWhy Schemaless - https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/why-schemaless\nProgressive Enhancement - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/\nMongoose CRUD - https://coursework.vschool.io/mongoose-crud/\nHomework\nGroup project - https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-projects#expressmongodb-projects\n"},"react/lesson1.html":{"url":"react/lesson1.html","title":"Week 18","keywords":"","body":"React 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nReact intro\nWhat is an SPA?\ncreate-react-app\nThinking in React\n\n\nReact concepts\nJSX\nFunctional components\nClass components\nEvent handlers\nState\nProps\n\n\n\nReact\nReact is a library by Facebook for building user interfaces. \nToday, the focus is on component based architectures. React provides a thin layer on top of JavaScript and HTML to allow you to build custom components. These components can encapsulate (hide within them) behavior and style and can be re-used throughout your application and even exported for others to use. \nWe already have some existing components in HTML. When you write this:\n\n\n..it generates this: \n\nAn \"input\" box, that only supports numbers, with a set of up/down arrows for changing the value, and a pre-defined value of 5. So the element tag tells the browser which element to render, and the attributes specify the settings for that element and any information we want to pass into it.\nWhy React?\nBesides providing the tools to build powerful and well encapsulated components, React also takes care of updating the HTML code to match our data.\nSuppose you make an HTTP GET request to \"http://blog.com/post?id=123\" and you store the result in a variable:\nvar post = {id: '123', title: 'Post 1', content: 'Lorem ipsum 1'};\n\nAnd our HTML looks like this:\n \n \n\nAs we've learned, we can dynamically insert content into our HTML using JavaScript:\ndocument.querySelector('#title').innerText = post.title;\ndocument.querySelector('#content').innerText = post.content;\n\nSo every time our post variable changes, we have to manually call the above to update our HTML, so the user can actually see the new post.\nHowever, with React, you can just set up your component once:\n {post.title} \n {post.content} \n\nAnd then whenever there's a change to post, React will take care of changing the DOM to match our new data.\n\nExercise: \nWhat does the above HTML remind you of? Any similar technology we studied recently that does something similar?\n\nWhat is an SPA?\nWith these features in mind, it suddenly becomes a lot easier to build Single Page Applications (SPA). \nSPAs run in the browser and fit in a single web page, providing a similar experience to desktop applications. All the content a page requires is usually downloaded at once (HTML, JavaScript and CSS), in the first initial request, or loaded dynamically as the user is clicking around the page. There are no reloads as you click from one section to the next.\n\nExercise\nWhat technology we used recently allows you to load data without reloading the page?\n\nLet's build an SPA!\ncreate-react-app\ncreate-react-app is a handy command line tool from Facebook that takes care of setting up the skeleton of your app, so you can start writing React code immediately, without having to worry about the setup.\nnpm install -g create-react-app\n\ncreate-react-app my-app\ncd my-app/\nnpm start\n\nOur first component\nComponents in React can be defined by just declaring a function that returns some HTML.\n\nCreate a new file in ./src/components/button.js\n\nCreate your first component\n\n\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction GameButton() {\n    return  Awesome button! ;\n}\n\nexport default GameButton;\n\n\nSwitch back to App.js and use your new custom component!\n\nimport GameButton from './components/gameButton';\n// .........\n  \n    \n  \n// .........\n\n\nCheck your browser, it should have refreshed with the latest changes\n\nClass components\nReact components are best understood in terms of parents and children.\nParent or container components may have access to the data that they need in order to pass it on to multiple child components. These larger components often contain the actions (e.g. API calls) or data processing functions that their child components require and thus are referred to as smart components.\nThese components are usually defined using ES6 classes. So instead of returning the JSX directly, it's returned as part of a render() function. Here's how we would define the button component we created above using ES6 classes:\nclass GameButton extends React.Components {\n\n  render() {\n    return  Awesome button! ;\n  }\n}\n\nThe above is an equivalent component to what we defined using the function. \nChild or \"presentational\" components are concerned with how things look. They contain very little logic. They are like a function: take some inputs, and return an element (and that's how they're usually written as well, as a function). They don't hold or remember any data: the element that they return is based only on the inputs they received, nothing else.\nWhile functional components are a lot simpler to read and write, using ES6 classes allows us to create more powerful, smarter components.\nJSX\nYou might have noticed something weird: we were returning some HTML-like code in our components.\nThat is called JSX, and it's a language almost identical to HTML that we can use inside our JavaScript components. You can also add JavaScript inside JSX. \nSince it's not exactly HTML, there are some gotchas you'll need to be aware of. For example, we can't assign the class attribute directly on elements, you'll need to use className:\nHTML: \nJSX: \nThinking in React\nLet's go over some examples and discuss how we would break everything up into smart and dumb components.\nEvent handlers\nTime to handle a few user events. We'll add a \"difficulty setting\" input, which will eventually change the number of buttons on the screen. For now, whenever the user changes that input, we will console.log the result.\n\nchangeNumberOfButtons = (event) => {\n  console.log(event.target.value);\n};\n\n//inside render()\n\n\n3 things to notice:\n\nthe curly brackets after onChange: surrounding something by two curly brackets is a way to use JavaScript inside JSX\nchangeNumberOfButtons is written as an arrow function: this is a good way to avoid issues with the this context in React. You can read more about it here: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/handling-events.html\nthe event object: this is an object passed to all event handlers. In our case we can use it to access the target DOM element of that event, and more specifically, its value.\n\nJSX: Rendering Arrays in Components\nBecause JSX works so well with JavaScript, we can even use it in for loops and build JavaScript arrays that contain JSX elements.\nAdding more game buttons would be easy, we can just copy-paste them one after another. But what if need a lot of them? Or what if we want to make their number dynamic, chosen by the user?\nLet's create a function that returns us an array of game buttons:\nbuildGame() {\n  let buttons =  [];\n  for(var i=0; i)\n  }\n  return buttons;\n}\n\nAnd then call it in our render() function:\n\n  \n  \n  {this.buildGame()}\n\n\nState\nA component's internal state represents all the information that a components \"knows\" about itself. \nState can only exist on class components. That is why they're also called stateful components.\nState can be accessed anywhere in the components using this.state.myName and can be set using this.setState({myName: \"hello\"}). \nsetState also tells React that our data has changed, so it can go ahead and re-render our view. Hence, it's very important that you never change state directly, and you only modify it using setState:\n//WRONG\nthis.state.myName = \"hello\";\n\n//CORRECT\nthis.setState({\n  myName: \"hello\"\n});\n\nRemember the change handler we added for our difficulty setting (changeNumberOfButtons)? And the array that builds our buttons array? Time to connect those two using state!\nStart by defining the initial state in the constructor:\nconstructor() {\n  super();\n  this.state = {\n    numberOfButtons: 10\n  };\n}\n\nNotice the call to super(). We always need to call that before referencing the this keyword in the constructor. In this case it calls the constructor() of the parent class React.Component. super is not a React function, it's an ES6 keyword used in class inheritance: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super\n  changeNumberOfButtons = (event) => {\n    this.setState({\n      numberOfButtons: event.target.value\n    });\n  };\n\n  buildGame() {\n    let buttons =  [];\n    for(var i=0; i)\n    }\n    return buttons;\n  }\n\n  \n\nNotice I'm also passing the state numberOfButtons to our input through the value attribute.\nNow go ahead and change the number of buttons in your input, and see the buttons update in real time. Try to keep it under 100 to avoid your browser freezing.\nProps\nRemember HTML attributes? \n\nProps are the inputs sent from the parent to child component via its attributes. So for our GameButton we could send it a prop that would specify what text it should display on the button:\n\nBut how do we access this \"text\" attribute internally and display it?\nfunction GameButton(props) {\n    return  {props.text} ;\n}\n\nAll the props get passed as properties of the \"props\" object, as the first argument of our component function.\nFor class components, props can be accessed via the this.props object:\nclass GameButton extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return {this.props.text}\n  }\n}\n\nLet's pass some props in our game!\nAdd a selected attribute to the button:\n\n\nThen let's give a different css class to our button depending on whether it's selected or not:\nimport './gameButton.css';\n\nfunction GameButton(props) {\n    let className = \"neutral\";\n    if(props.selected === true) {\n        className = \"selected\";\n    }\n    return  Awesome button! ;\n}\n\nCreate the gameButton.css file and define your rules:\n.neutral {\n    background: lightgrey;\n}\n\n.selected {\n    background: red;\n}\n\nNow try changing the selected attribute on your GameButton. It should change color depending on whether it's true or false.\nRecap\nNow you know enough React to build the rest of the game!\nLet's quickly recap some of the topics we learned:\n\nWhy React?\nSPA?\nWhat are smart and dumb components?\nWhat's a class components vs a function components?\nJSX?\nEvent handlers?\nState?\nProps?\n\nSelecting a button\nCurrently, we have to manually send true/false to select a button. Let's change our logic so buttons are selected at random.\nAdd a selectedButton property to our state: \n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      numberOfButtons: 10,\n      selectedButton: -1\n    };\n  }\n\nAdd a function that generates a random number between zero and the number of buttons we have and stores that on the state: \n  selectRandomButton = () => {\n    const randomIndex = this.getRandomInt(0, this.state.numberOfButtons);\n    this.setState({\n      selectedButton: randomIndex\n    })\n  }\n\n  getRandomInt(min, max) {\n    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;\n  }\n\nModify the buildGame() function so it only selects the button that's been marked on the state:\nbuttons.push()\n\nAdd a timer\nLet's a delay between the time we press \"Start game\" and one of the buttons getting selected:\n  startGame = () => {\n    setTimeout(this.selectRandomButton, 2000);\n  }\n\n  ///render()\n  Start game\n\nAdd a click handler to our buttons\n\n\nAnd our click handler:\ngameButtonClick = (event) => {\n  const className = event.target.className;\n  if(className.includes('selected')) {\n    alert(\"GOOD JOB\");\n  }\n};\n\nClick on \"Start game\" and wait for one of the buttons to become selected. Once a button becomes selected, click on it. Hmm, it still doesn't work.\nThat's because inside our GameButton component, we are doing nothing to handle the onClick prop we're sending in. Let's change that!\nInside gameButton.js:\n\nCalculate how fast you click on a button\nThis is the point where we add a challenge and turn our app into a game. We need to calculate how fast the user reacts to a button being selected. \nAdd a start and end time to the state:\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      numberOfButtons: 10,\n      selectedButton: -1,\n      startTime: 0\n    };\n  }\n\n  // When a random gets selected set the START TIME\n  selectRandomButton = () => {\n    const randomIndex = this.getRandomInt(0, this.state.numberOfButtons);\n    this.setState({\n      selectedButton: randomIndex,\n      startTime: new Date().getTime()\n    })\n  }\n\n  // When the user manages to click on the selected button, display the time passed between start and end\n  gameButtonClick = (event) => {\n    const className = event.target.className;\n    if(className.includes('selected')) {\n      const currTime = new Date().getTime();\n      alert(currTime - this.state.startTime);\n    }\n  };\n\nInstead of alerting the time, display it on the screen\nAdd an endTime property to the state, initialized with 0.\nModify your game button click function so that it stores the time it was clicked on the state (and remove the alert):\ngameButtonClick = (event) => {\n  const className = event.target.className;\n  if(className.includes('selected')) {\n    this.setState({\n      endTime: new Date().getTime() \n    });\n  }\n};\n\nIn your render function, print out the final value:\nfunction getScore() {\n  return this.state.endTime > 0\n    ? this.state.endTime - this.state.startTime\n    : \"Not yet started..\";\n}\n\n//in render()\nScore: {this.getScore()}\n\nHomework\n\nDisplay the last 10 scores\nDisplay the overall top score\nOnce you click the \"Start game\" button, make the button flash after a random number of seconds\n\n"},"react/lesson2.html":{"url":"react/lesson2.html","title":"Week 19","keywords":"","body":"React Lesson 2\nIn this lesson we're going to go through a recap of props and state, then we'll hand out a set of small tasks/apps to build in the browser with create-react-app. Most of them should take anywhere from 30 mins to an hour, you won't be expected to finish them all but you will not be given much starting code - they aim is for you to get a good grasp of solving problems in React.\nRecap\nComponent\nAt the highest level in React - you have components. These are created usually with 1 per file using the class syntax, like this:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return Hello World!\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent\n\nAll components declared with this syntax must have a render method. To this component, you need to import it into where you want to render from (so from a different file, in the same directory as the above file):\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent.js'\n\nThen, inside of this file you can write  inside your JSX to render it out. Like so:\nclass ParentComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return \n  }\n}\n\nexport default ParentComponent\n\nProps\nProps are passed in when you render a component. They always come from a parent component, and when they are passed down into a child they cannot be changed after that point.\nIn this example, we are rendering a Profile component by passing it a person's name and age as props.\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport Profile from './Profile'\n\nclass MyComponent extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyComponent\n\nNow, if we go take a look at the Profile component we can see how those props actually appear on the page:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nclass Profile extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Name: {this.props.name}\n        Age: {this.props.age}\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Profile\n\nNotice how to get access to those props we ask for them off of this, and then we wrap them inside curly braces {} to tell jsx that we want it to actually evaluate those javascript variables.\nThe above component could have also been written as a functional component, both are valid but we'll be sticking to the class syntax for the rest of the examples. Here is the same component defined using the function syntax:\nimport React from 'react' // don't need to import Component\n\nfunction Profile(props) {\n  return (\n    \n      Name: {props.name}\n      Age: {props.age}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nexport default Profile\n\nState\nTo manage values that can change in your application - you store those values in a component's state. We must use class components if we want to store state, and to update the state we need to use this.setState, passing it the new object to put in our state. If we use this method to update our state - react will magically handle updating the html/output for us.\nClick here to view the next example in a browser. Try it out and understand what it's doing before we take a look at the code for it.\nOnce you've done that - take a look at the implementation:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react'\n\nclass Counter extends Component {\n\n  // To initialise our state, we create a constructor and\n  // directly set the state.\n  // This is the **only** place we should ever write \"this.state =\"\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    this.state = {\n      counter: 0\n    }\n  }\n\n  // this function will increase the number we have\n  // in our counter by 1 each time it is called\n  incrementCounter = () => {\n    // we're calling a React-provided method\n    // here to update our state\n    this.setState({\n      counter: this.state.counter + 1\n    })\n  }\n\n  // this function does the same as the above except it will\n  // reduce the number we have in the state by 1\n  decrementCounter = () => {\n    this.setState({\n      counter: this.state.counter - 1\n    })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // here we render out the current counter with\n    // two buttons, with onClicks that reference\n    // the functions we created above\n    return (\n      \n        \n        Counter:{this.state.counter}\n        +\n        -\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nThat's almost it for the recap, before we jump into the next part - have a go at trying to extend this counter example. Here's a few ideas that you could try:\n\nChange the colour of the counter, based on whether or not it's an even number (demo here)\nAdd another button that multiplies the number by 2 (demo here)\nAdd a slider that modifies that multiplier (demo here)\nSo moving the slider to the left makes the multiplier 2, but moving it further to the right will increase the multiplier to 2,3,4 etc.\n\n\nMake the number of counters dynamic (demo here)\nSo you have a remove counter button next to each counter, and an \"add new counter\" button at which will add a new counter\nEach counter should have it's own value\n\n\nHave a go at implementing #4 using a second component\n\nFurther Examples:\n\nGuess Who example\nTODO App example\nCheckboxes example\n\nTalking to an API\nUp until this point we've been building things that are entirely inside our browser - we've never really spoken to another API. We're now going to look into how we would do that.\nFirst of all, it's important to remember that as soon as we start to talk to another service then we have to start thinking about things happening asynchronously (remember callbacks?). React gives you access to a group of things called lifecycle methods to be able to do this.\nThe most commonly used lifecycle methods (other than render and a constructor) are componentDidMount and componentShouldUpdate.\ncomponentDidMount is the place where you'd want to make things like API calls and setup. It gets called after render.\ncomponentShouldUpdate is typically used for performance - if you've got state changing a lot and you're making React re-render things really often then you can use this method to control whether or not it should.\nIn this example, we're going to load in a list of countries to display them on a page, let's walk through an example of doing that:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super()\n    // we're going to store our list of countries in the state as an array\n    this.state = {\n      countries: []\n    }\n  }\n\n  // This is our Lifecycle Method\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // here we can pass a url to fetch() and it will return a promise\n    fetch('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all')\n    // then we parse the JSON response from the API\n      .then(response => response.json())\n    // we pass the parsed json into a method on our component\n      .then(this.updateWithCountries)\n  }\n\n  updateWithCountries = (countryList) => {\n    // we call this method when we've finished fetching the countries\n    this.setState({\n      countries: countryList\n    })\n  }\n\n  renderCountry = (country, idx) => {\n    // in our render method we pass this in to the map to create multiple children\n    return (\n      \n        Name: {country.name}\n        Population: {country.population}\n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.countries.map(this.renderCountry)}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nHomework\nUsing React:\n\nRender list of cakes using this json url\nAdd ability to search cakes\n(Optional) Add basic ability to edit/add cakes\n\n"},"react/lesson3.html":{"url":"react/lesson3.html","title":"Week 20","keywords":"","body":"React 3\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nFetching data into components\nInstalling React components from npm\nHow to build an app using react-router\n\nChallenge 1: render a list of albums\n\nGo to https://github.com/djgrant/beyonce-app and follow the instructions to clone and install the app.\n\nYou'll find in the components folder an Album component already written for you to use, and an Albums component that you need to complete\n\nIn the Albums component fetch an array of albums from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rarmatei/f5ae92ac93d9716affab822a3f54f95b/raw/e62641b3f5ddd12c4fe34aa0912488224594e5a7/beyonce-albums.json.\n\nUsing the data returned from the API, render an array of Album components, passing in the necessary props.\n\n\nThings you will need to know:\n\nFetch\nExample: http://jsbin.com/qafekejato/edit?js,console  \nTutorial: https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/\n\n\nlifecycle methods\nTutorial/Exmaple: https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/scotland/react/lesson2.md#talking-to-an-api\n\n\nState\nExample: https://codesandbox.io/s/q83vz50yl9\nTutorial: https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html\n\n\n\nChallenge 2: add routes to your app\nIn this challenge we'll split your app into 3 pages.\n\nIn your app install react-router by running npm install react-router --save\n\nOpen https://codesandbox.io/s/pj6v9x94x0 to see a basic example of a React app using react-router.\n\nCopy the react-router imports over to your app\n\nWrap your app in a  component\n\nMove the 3 sections in your app into s\n\nAdd a navigation bar to your app with links to the routes you've created\n\nMove the content of each Route into individual files, and import them in index.js using the   component prop.\n\n\nChallenge 3: install components to style your app\nReact components can be configured with props, which makes them ideal for sharing with others.\nThere are all sorts of React components that you can install and use in your projects.\nIn the challenge you'll add a video player to the Album component.\n\nOpen the Album component\n\nUsing npm, install react-player\n\nFollowing the instructions on the readme add a react-player component into Album\n\nUpdate your Albums component to pass in a videoUrl to the Album component\n\nAdd videoUrl as a prop type to the Album component\n\n\nHomework\n\nFind some more content and add another route to your App\nUsing react-router, show the About route content in tabs (see the how this is achieved in https://codesandbox.io/s/pj6v9x94x0)\nEnhance the pages using components provided by reactstrap (Bootstrap for React)\n(Advanced) Abstract the tabs functionality into a component that you could share with other developers\n\n"},"react/lesson4.html":{"url":"react/lesson4.html","title":"Week 21","keywords":"","body":"React 4\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nReact Native Workshop\n\n"},"house-rules.html":{"url":"house-rules.html","title":"House Rules","keywords":"","body":"House Rules\n\nWhilst you're a student, arrive on time. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other commitments to be here. Respect that, and always be on time.\n\nLeave our space cleaner and tidier than when we arrive. We are hosted by generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!) to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in English!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and finding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help but do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the best ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community.
