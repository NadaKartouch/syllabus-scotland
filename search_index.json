The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using NodeJS, and modern front-end development with React. We’ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...\nUnder Construction\nThis is the repo for the updated CYF Syllabus.\nFor the version that is being taught in our first London class, please check Syllabus-book\n"},"lesson0.html":{"url":"lesson0.html","title":"Week 0","keywords":"","body":"\nLesson 0\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nCodeYourFuture\nWelcome task\nTerminal\nGit\nIDEs\nHomework\n\n\nCodeYourFuture\n\nWho we are?\nWhat we learn?\nRead this Technology Survey from StackOverflow. Pay particular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript, React, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have built\na website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to learn about\nthe tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools will be used during\nthe course, so it is important that you become familiarised with them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home: move your\nCodePen website to a web address under https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website, in a location\nwhere other developers can make changes to it and view a history of all the updates that\nyou have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting below,\nplease read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any point, please\nask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the lesson, and will explain\nthem in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen. Help >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note of the\nlocation of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository. How does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.\nThis is a view of your code, and you should see a list of your files, including an index.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name,\nfind the settings icon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source, then hit\n\"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages section.\nYou should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at http://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\".\nClick the link, verify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as command line)\nwill be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to interact with you computer\nfaster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like you\nto get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please find\ninstructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the instructions,\nopen a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You will see something\nlike this:\n\n  \n\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications available in\nyour computer. More instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool called \"Git Bash\".\nWhen the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line, please open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control). It's\nlike Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\nExtract from Git Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by si618 explains very well why we use Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use, and by far the most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen learn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more intermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically to fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a repo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the local repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to setup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in our case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install Git git config --global user.name  and git config --global user.email .\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we recommend becoming \ncomfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the steps for the different \nworkflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with Pull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our code.\nGithub is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large companies,\nlike Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git - https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they do: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you will\nbe using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop your apps\nquickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of having to search\nGoogle for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides \"auto-completion\".\nThis means that it will give you suggestions of what you can can write next, while\nyou are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can assign\nit to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave the\nwindow to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files can be\ndone directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from something called\na \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of your IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly, without\nhaving to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of VS Code. Please\ngo ahead and install it, then try opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free to check out their\nwebsites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now. Please use the\ninformation in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name, please send\na link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update CSS.\nCommit your changes to Github and verify that https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name\nhas been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right!\nWhen it happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"html-css/lesson1.html":{"url":"html-css/lesson1.html","title":"Week 1","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 1\nWhat will we learn today?\n\nSemantic HTML tags\nCSS selectors, CSS cascade, Pseudo-classes such as :hover/:focus\nBox model: margin/padding/border etc...\nCSS specificity\n\n\nWhat makes a web page?\n\nSeparation of Concerns: In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. (Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this GitHub repository. Fork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal commands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming):  Work in pairs to determine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\n\nCSS Inheritance\nSome CSS styles applied to one element will be \"inherited\" by their child elements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements, such as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and borders, don't get passed down to children.\n\nIn English, the word inherit refers to something, like the color of your eyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how \"child\" HTML elements can inherit styles from \"parent\" HTML elements.\n\nWe'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and why.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the background properties to add a assets/jumbotron-background.jpg to the jumbotron. Did these styles have \"inheritance\"? Why do you think they did or did not?\n\nNow that the background image is in place, the text is difficult to read. The text needs to be white.\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use just one CSS rule to set all of the text in the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do you think some styles, like text color, get inherited?\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n    background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\n\nThe Cascade\nCSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The \"cascade\" is a set of rules which the browser uses to choose what to do when two CSS rules conflict. Take the following example:\n.btn {\n    color: red;\n}\n.btn {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\nShould the .btn be red or blue? When identical selectors are next to each other like this, the browser lets the last one override the first one. But in a real-world scenario, you may have CSS scattered across different files. To solve this, we use the cascade.\n\nExercise: Read the section on the cascade. Then pair up. In the example, there are two paragraphs. Pick one paragraph and explain to your partner why it has a particular background color. Then ask your partner to explain the other paragraph.\nExercise: Work in pairs to give each one of the navigation menu items a red border (#ce5f31). This border should only appear when the mouse is hovering over it or the item has focus. Then use what you've learned about the cascade to give the first navigation menu item (\"Home\") a different color border.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n    border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about advanced CSS selectors and then practice by playing this CSS selector game.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n    body {\n        background: red;\n    }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays might be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is larger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nContent Layout: Flexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\nIf you finish early, you can add some text in each box and position it in the middle of the box.\nExercise: Working independently, try to position the articles and images side-by-side under the \"Upcoming Events\" section. Use this screenshot to guide you. If you get stuck, go ahead and ask your partner. Never be afraid to ask!\nHint: you might need to create a container for the text pieces!\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the Flexbox Froggy game as you can. This will stretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's ok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.\n(Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from Flexbox Zombies\n(Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about positioning content in CSS using floats and absolute positioning.\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process. Look at the documentation for Bootstrap 4 and look at their examples to see how they are building components.\n\n"},"html-css/lesson3.html":{"url":"html-css/lesson3.html","title":"Week 3","keywords":"","body":"HTML/CSS 3\n\nDesign frameworks\nBootstrap 4 and HTML/CSS frameworks\nHTML forms\nGit branching and pull requests\nNaming patterns (OOCSS, BEM)\n\n\nDesign Frameworks\nA design framework is a collection of re-usable code snippets which you can use to build a website. It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or \"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.\n\nThe main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.\nThe BBC's Global Experience Language is a design framework. It calls it's components design patterns and in the foundations section you'll find discussion of layouts and typography.\n\nExercise: Look at the Promos design pattern. As a group, let's try to name all the parts of a Promo that we'll need to consider when designing the component? Now do the same with the Carousel pattern.\n\nOpen-source HTML/CSS/JS Frameworks\nBootstrap and Foundation are popular examples of open-source HTML/CSS/JS frameworks. They help you construct your own design framework by providing a number of re-usable components that are common for web applications.\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we load in our HTML pages. Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a grid layout as well as several components.\n\nExercise: Fork this repository and follow the instructions in the readme to create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise illustrating git branching and pull requests. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull request. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master branch and update your copy.\n\nHTML Forms\nForms provide tools for visitors to your webpage to interact by entering details, making selections or performing other actions. When you write an update on Facebook, you're entering a message into a form field, and \"posting\" that message to Facebook.\n\nExercise: Read this guide on HTML forms. Then add a form to your new page. The form should include fields for the user to write their name, email address and a message. It should also include a button.\nExercise: Look at the documentation for Bootstrap's form components. Update your form to use Bootstrap's form groups, form controls and buttons. When you're done, create a new branch, commit, and issue a pull request.\n\nNaming Patterns (OOCSS/BEM)\nWe use naming patterns to organise our code so that it is easier for colleagues to work with our code -- and easier for us to work with our colleagues' code. In a team of developers, you will need to understand, read and make use of a naming pattern.\nBootstrap uses a naming pattern called Object-Oriented CSS (OOCSS). The goal is to define an object, which is another word for a component, and come up with a set of re-usable class names appropriate for that object.\n\n    You have successfully completed your task.\n\n\n    You did not complete your task.\n\n\n.alert {\n    padding: .75rem 1.25rem;\n    border-radius: 0.25em;\n}\n.alert-success {\n    background-color: green;\n}\n.alert-error {\n    background-color: red;\n}\n\nExercise: As a group, let's explore the naming patterns in Bootstrap's Card component. How is the object-oriented naming pattern used here?\nExercise: Read the documentation on Bootstrap's Card styles. Apply style adjustments to the cards in your project example.\n\nOne of the goals in a naming pattern is to communicate purpose. Let's look at the following example of Bootstrap's Card component:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\nWe have three types of class names here:\n\n.card is the object.\n.card-block, .card-title, and .card-text are sub-objects.\n.card-inverted is a modifier.\n\nWith Bootstrap's naming pattern, we know an object is a single word class name like .card, .btn or .alert. But our other two types of class names share the same naming pattern: .card-inverted and .card-block.\nThe Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) naming pattern is an attempt to overcome this. It introduces separate naming structures for all three types of class names.\n\nThe object is called a \"Block\": .card.\nThe sub-objects are called \"Elements\" and are written with 2 underscores: .card__block, .card__title and .card__text.\nThe modifier is written with 2 dashes as: .card--inverted.\n\nIf we changed our Card example to use BEM syntax, it would look like this:\n\n    \n        Card title\n        Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.\n    \n\n\n\"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things\" - Phil Karlton\n\nHomework\n\nLook at as much of the Bootstrap 4 Documentation as you can.\nAdd Bootstrap to the website you've been building for your homework.\nAdd a new HTML page to the website you've been building for your homework. Use Bootstrap's form components to a contact form to this page.\nModify the articles in the website you've been building for your homework.

Tie into the idea of how in a program these would be the ‘tools’ required for an activity and how for our sandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes\n\n\nNow that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students to shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:\nWrite the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object would be needed to carry out that instruction\nCopy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have decided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods\nContinue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the objects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects are required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with the students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction – could be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in programming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of this exercise)\n\n\nOnce the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed class and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each instruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in programming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to codepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left, click the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression, such as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result, in the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions in the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a variable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You can assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now a variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not contain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string or boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You can also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate a statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1\n15\n3195803798\n1.4\n0.0000005\n0\n-23\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers (decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers. Numbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math operators that you would expect:\n2 + 2 // 4\n2 - 5 // -3\n2 * 3 // 6\n10 / 2 // 5\n3 * -2 // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher precedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or double quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape” them by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the JavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a quote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is called string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that can only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different operators for booleans (analoguous to Boolean algebra). The most important ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:!true // false\n!false // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // false\nfalse && true // false\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:false && false // false\ntrue && false // true\nfalse && true // true\ntrue && true // true\n\n\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2, 2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13\nExercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r * pi). Do a quick Google search on how to use PI in JavaScript.\nSee what happens when you \"add\" two strings together\nResearch the JS Math library. sqrt, floor, ceil, round\nWrite an expression that outputs the percentage of students who are female. Make it so it outputs it as 58%, and make sure you use the actual numbers of women and the total number of students.\nSolution: console.log(Math.round(7 / 17 * 100) + \"%\");\n\nFrom REPL to console.log\n\nSingle expressions are not very useful, you want to write applications\nMore than one statement? Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent when it actually re-runs a program. Maybe a different tool is better? A simple jsbin configuration, maybe?\n\n"},"js-core/lesson1.html":{"url":"js-core/lesson1.html","title":"Week 1","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core 1\n\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nHello World\nData  Types\nVariables\nConditionals: If/else\nLoops\n\nThis class is based on the Node Girls JS Workshop\n\nGetting Started\n\nDownload and install the latest Current version of NodeJS - from https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/\n\nTo test that it was installed and running properly, go to your terminal and run the command:\nnode -v\nYou should get the node version printed on your terminal, for example, v7.3.0\n\nFork the repositroy - https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises and Clone it locally.\n\nOnce you have the repo locally, go to the folder on your terminal and run node main.js\n\n\nYou should get Hello World printed on your Terminal.\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make it say \"Hello world!\". This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using something called a console.log().\nconsole.log()\nWhen we ran the command node main.js - that did log to the console printing the words Hello World to the terminal. \nLet's open the file main.js and investigate its contents\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you notice about the code? Anything you don't understand? Notice the semicolon, the dot, the parantheses - these are all elements of JavaScript Syntax\n\nTry to console.log() something different, for example, Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!. (run node main.js after each change and look at the output in the console)\n\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\n\nComments\nYou can put comments to help you and others understand your code - use // to add a comment (or if it is a multi-line comment, then use /* and */ around your comment)\n// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code\nconsole.log('Hello world!');\n\nconsole.log('Hello World'); // comments can also be in the same line like this\n/*\nI can also make comments\nover more than one line if necessary\n*/\nconsole.log('Hello World');\n\n\nExercises What are the comments in that main.js script.\n\nNode?\nWe ran our JavaScript using Node -  Node is is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Wikipedia\n\nExercises What are other \"places\" where we can run JavaScript code?\n\nData Types\nIf you played around with console.log() in the last step, you might have noticed that words always have to be inside quotes or else the code breaks, whereas numbers can work without quotes. Why is this? Well these are different data types in JavaScript. You'll need to learn the three main data types to get started coding (later we'll look at some other data types, like objects and arrays).\nStrings\nStrings are simple text, ranging anywhere from a single character to lengthy paragraphs. A string is always written inside a pair of quotes (single or double).\n'node girls'\n\nNumbers\nNumbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes like strings, and can just be written as is.\n100 // an integer number\n100.89 // a decimal number (floating point)\n\nBooleans\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a \"boolean\" value. A boolean is either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\ntrue\n\nYou've seen what they look like, now make sure they are what you think they are. There is a built-in feature in JavaScript which allows you to check the type of a particular value: typeof.\nWrite this code in your main.js, and run it (using node main.js in the terminal):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Hello world!');\n\nYou should see string printed to the console.\n\nExercise Now try that three times, once for each data type. Log the typeof for three different values: \"Code Your Future\", 6 and false. You should get different output for each one.\n\nVariables\nWhen you code, you'll want to create shortcuts so you can easily refer to things without writing out the same value every time. In JavaScript we have variables, which allow us to store values to use later.\n\nThink of variables names like labels on boxes, while the value of the variable are the contents of the box - you could change the contents of a box and leave the label intact, the contents of the boxes can have different types, the boxes should have good labels (a box of books being labeled pens would be very confusing),\n\nPhoto from Khan Academy\n\nTry it out\nYou create a variable using the keyword var, which lets the application know that you're about to store a value. You also have to give a name to your variable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a string called \"Glasgow\".\nvar city = 'Glasgow';\n\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write the name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing out Glasgow every time. You don't put quotes around a variable name.\nTry to run the above code, and see what is printed to the console.\n\nExercise\nIn the above example, what will happen if we change the second line to console.log(\"city\") - Do you notice the difference? What do you think will be the output?\n\nYou should have some code left over from previous steps which looks something like this (maybe even with comments):\nconsole.log(typeof 'Code Your Future');\nconsole.log(typeof 6);\nconsole.log(typeof false);\n\n\nExercise: Now that you know how to create variables, rewrite this code. This time, define these values as variables at the top of the file, create a variable called courseName and assign it the value Code Your Future. Then create a variable called courseDuration and assign it the value 6, and a variable called isHard and assign it the value false.\nRefer to the three variables that you just created to get their types (i.e. console.log(typeof courseName) etc...)\nIs your output the same?\n\nIf/Else Statements\nNow we're going to start adding in some logic. So far we have been logging the same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according to different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else statement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the outcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do something else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and something else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of true or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the variable isHappy is equal to true. Note that in JavaScript, to test if two things are equal you need to use a triple equals (===) rather than just one (=).\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are there to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log('Hello world!');\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(':(');\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable from true to false.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is even, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print 'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator, which looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1 // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0 // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or negative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print 'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'. \nHint: You can use the > or  signs.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\nFor Loops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing the same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in JavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of times, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value. It is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an iteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're at. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i=0\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen for the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less than or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the loop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put i++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni+=2\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the loop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i=1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there. The length is set to be less than or equal to 10, as we want the loop to end there. And we are increasing the value of i by one each time.\n\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that loops over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing only every second number. So it should return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10....\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 divisble by 5. \nSee if you can think or more than one way to solve this.\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nFunctions\nWe've been writing code that performs different actions, but sometimes you want to group code together to achieve a particular end. This is where functions come in.\nA function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when it is \"invoked\".\nThe syntax of a function looks like this:\nfunction functionName (parameters) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nYou can call a function whatever you want, just like a variable. You can also give a function different values every time you run it which are called \"parameters\".\nTo make the function run, we invoke it like so:\nfunctionName();\n\nTry it out\nLet's write a function that adds two numbers together. We'll call it add. We want to add together two different numbers every time, so let's define two parameters to represent this, x and y.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nNotice I've invoked the function underneath, with the paremeters 2 and 3. Inside the function, try to console.log() your parameters and see what happens.\nNow, we want to add these two numbers together, but it isn't enough just to write x + y, since we haven't told the function to return anything. It's time for a return statement. The return statement specifies the value to output.\nfunction add (x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nRun this code, and hopefully you get the right answer!\n\nExercise \nWrite a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. It should take two numbers as parameters and return the answer.\nExercise\nGo back and copy the code to your previous solution for printing the sum of numbers between 1 and 100. Put this code inside a function.\nChange the function so it accepts any two limits and prints the sum of all the numbers between those limits.\nFor example: addBetween(1,3) should print 6\n\nResources\n\nData Types\nComparison Operators\nArithmetic Operators\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in JavaScript!\n\nFollow this course on Khan Academy.

Arrays are to the rescue!\nImagine an array like a list or a collection of variables, but instead of each variable having its own name, only the array has a name. So how do you access a variable inside, then? How do you read and write? Using an index!\nAn index is just a whole number, such as 0, 1, 2 and so forth. As in many areas of computing, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is the index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second element, and so forth.\nThe syntax is to list the values separated by commas, inside square brackets:\n[value1, value2, value3]\n\nYou can store any type of value inside an array: strings, numbers, booleans. You can even store other arrays, or objects (which you will learn about next).\nTry it out\nDefining an array as a variable looks something like this:\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to define them separately. You can see how many animals there are by using .length:\nconsole.log(animals.length);\n\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using their \"index number\" like so.\nconsole.log(animals[1]);\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out \"puppy\". That might seem weird, until you learn that JavaScript is a \"0-index\" language. What that means is that counting in JavaScript starts at 0. So animals[0]will print out \"tiger\". We don't make the rules...\n\nExercise: \n\nCreate an array that contains the countries of all the students in the class (at least five nationalities)\nconsole.log the number of countries in the Array\nNow, console.log() each country in the list. Hint: For loops\n\nDon't ask a mentor - Google it! Try googling to find the answer if you're stuck. Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nObjects\nNow for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits of information, except objects store the properties of something. For example, you might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time and location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThe syntax looks like this:\n{\n  property1: \"value1\",\n  property2: \"value2\",\n  property3: \"value3\"\n}\n\nThe names on the left (\"property1\") are known \"keys\". Any values can be given to them: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of the properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise\nUsing an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence introducing the person. Print out the following:\n\"Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a {occupation}.\"\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes variables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// \"People call me Jane\"\n\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does this work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method you can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to how console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array you want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria'];\nvar moreCountries = ['Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France'];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\nconsole.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last existing element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = 'United States of America';\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push('United States of America');\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push('United States of America', 'France');\n\n\nExercise: Search .slice, .splice and .pop and tell us what they do\n\nResources\n\nArrays\nObjects\nStrings\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you have forked during the last class contains few challenges - solve them all in JavaScript.

We need to make sure our software is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure our programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause severe bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users of your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example integration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal with unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean different things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments), do something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the return statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if the same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what we want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain input, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the output matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an equality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and complains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in unit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a function result to an expected value.\n\nTogether: Follow the instructions in unit-testing/sum.js!\nExercise: Now you! Take the provided unit-testing/findNeedle.js and turn it into a function that returns a result instead of\nprinting it. Then run it using multiple inputs and make sure it returns the correct results each time!\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only. (Wikipedia)\n\nA key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we dive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?\nWe formalise those requirements by writing tests - even before our program is written! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any code yet. Our tests are now RED (the colour represents a failing test).\nNow we want to turn this RED into GREEN. We do this by implementing our function in a way that covers all our test cases.\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions in tdd/findNeedle.js!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any functionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a certain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called refactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore, we call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we refactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not regress.\n\nTogether: Refactor the findNeedle function we just wrote to be implemented using .map() and .filter().\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being equal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if a function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before another thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit testing frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do is provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called Jest. It's created by Facebook and useful for all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a later lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find two files there, sum.js and sum.test.js. The suffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To execute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function exported by sum.js. You can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest('test description', function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests. They are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one call of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one file. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10 really zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it into the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to be used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple inputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest runs your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells you how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions, statements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if you have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be covered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to generate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the numbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nModules\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.\nTODO: Restructure this section so it fits the order better\nSeparating code and tests\nRemember when we talked about exporting and importing code using modules? This is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js\nmain.test.js\nsomeOtherCode.js\nsomeOtherCode.test.js\n\nThis is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder!\nExercise: Take the test you have just created and put it into a separate file. Then import the function to be tested in the test file and run the test file (instead of the file containing your function).\n\nImporting modules\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it, and this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar findNeedle = require('./findNeedle.js');\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as findNeedle.js, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the findNeedle variable.\nWe can then continue to use the findNeedle function as if it we defined it in our own program!\nvar haystack = ['hay', 'hay', 'needle', 'hay'];\nconsole.log(\"Found needle at position \" + findNeedle(haystack));\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.\nExercise: In your main.js file, import the provided third-party.js and console.log its result.\n\nCreating modules\nAs mentioned, it is good practice to split your code into different modules. You do not need one file per function, but you can group similar functionality together.\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported (remember, using require()).\n\nExercise: Take a function that you created in last week's homework (other than findNeedle()). Put it in a separate file and export it, as described above. Name the file like your function, so when your function is called myGreatFunction, name your file myGreatFunction.js.\nThen require() and use it in main.js and make sure this program runs.\n\nResources\n\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\n\nHomework\nTODO\nResearch\n\nResearch other module formats than CommonJS.

These are often referred to as dumb components - because they do not process the data in themselves:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Organisation extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const name = this.props.name;\n    const website = this.props.website;\n    return (\n        \n            Name: {name} \n            Website: {website}\n        \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Organisation;\n\n\nProps exercise\n\nJSX: Map Arrays to Components\nWhen working with APIs we often have collections of things in Arrays which we want to map to components. This means we can loop through that data and display the customisable dumb component for each one.\n\nrenderOrganisations() {\n    const orgData = [{ name: 'Organisation 1', borough: 'Camden'}, {name: 'Organisation 2'}];\n    return orgData.map(function renderData(organisation) {\n        return (\n            \n        )\n    });\n}\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n      return (\n        \n          {this.renderOrganisations()}\n        \n      );\n  }\n}\n\n\nMapping Exercise\n\nState\nSometimes a component needs to react to data that doesn't come from a parent component. This is where the component's State comes in.\nProps are a Compenent's configuration, they are received from above and they don't usually change by the component itself.\nState starts with a default value (set in the constructor typically) then it gets changed (mutated) by events of the application (user interactions, form input, API calls etc..)\nExample:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Organisation from './Organisation';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n        website: null\n    }\n  }\n\n  handleChange(event) {\n    this.setState({website: event.target.value});\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\nState Exercise\n\nComponent Life Cycle\n\nComponents have life cycle events which are methods that run code at particular times in the process. According to the time that the methods are called, some of them are often prefixed with will and did.\nThe diagram below shows the full picture of what happens during the rendering of a component. Even though you have all these methods available to use at your disposal, the only required method is render().\n\nMounting\nThese are called when a component is being mounted on the DOM such as:\n\nConstructor()\ncomponentWillMount()\nrender()\netc\n\nUpdating\nWhen there are changes to the props or state:\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\nrender()\netc\n\nUnmonting\nWhen a component is being removed from the DOM:\n\ncomponentWillUnmount()\n\nOther APIs\nThese include setState() and forceUpdate(). You cannot access the state in some lifecycle methods, refer to the diagram above to find out which.\nThe complete list of these methods with their descriptions can be found in the documentation here.\nAPI calls\nIn order to make an API called you can call the functions same\ncallAPI = () => {\n    const APIAddress = 'https://code-your-future.github.io/api-demo/area/All/index.json';\n    fetch(APIAddress)\n    .then(function(response) {\n      return response.json();\n    })\n    .then(function(jsonData) {\n      this.setState({ orgData: jsonData });\n    });\n}\n\nIn order to use this function when the component first loads we will call it in the componentDidMount() lifecycle method.\ncomponentDidMount() {\n    this.callAPI();\n}\n\nOnce the state is updated with the data, your component will re-render.\nHomework\n\nLesson 2 Homework\n\n"},"react/lesson3.html":{"url":"react/lesson3.html","title":"Week 3","keywords":"","body":"React Lesson 3\nRecap\n\nReact\ncreate-react-app magic\nImportant parts of a component:\nConstructor, Render\nLifecycle methods: componentDidMount\n\n\nDumb and Smart Components (props and state)\nJSX\nReact component always capitalised\nEmbedding code\nMapping arrays\n\n\nES6: Class, extends, constructor, modules (import/export), arrow functions, this, others: const/let\nThinking in React\n\n\n\nIn development you are often given specification of a piece work with example design and data:\n\n[\n  {\"category\": \"Sporting Goods\", \"price\": \"$49.99\", \"stocked\": true, \"name\": \"Football\"},\n  {\"category\": \"Sporting Goods\", \"price\": \"$9.99\", \"stocked\": true, \"name\": \"Baseball\"},\n  {\"category\": \"Sporting Goods\", \"price\": \"$29.99\", \"stocked\": false, \"name\": \"Basketball\"},\n  {\"category\": \"Electronics\", \"price\": \"$99.99\", \"stocked\": true, \"name\": \"iPod Touch\"},\n  {\"category\": \"Electronics\", \"price\": \"$399.99\", \"stocked\": false, \"name\": \"iPhone 5\"},\n  {\"category\": \"Electronics\", \"price\": \"$199.99\", \"stocked\": true, \"name\": \"Nexus 7\"}\n];\n\nSteps to conceptualise the solution with React:\n\n1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy\n2: Build A Static Version\n3: Identify the State and where it should live\n\nExercise: Code Review\nUnit Testing\n\nImportance of testing: Why do we do need it?\nThe problem with Legacy code: Legacy code is any code that doesn't have tests\n\n\nTypes of testing:\nManual: Smoke testing, QA testing\nAutomated: Functional/Unit, Integration, End-to-End\nRegression testing\n\n\nUnit Tests: normally they are developer's responsibility\nTDD/BDD\n\n\nTool chain: Lots of tools, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Jest etc etc - Do not worry at this stage\n\nExercise: Unit testing\nRouting\nReact can be used as a Single Page Application, i.e. providing full experience of an application with many views within one page with several components.\nHowever it is still possible to support routing by associating and displaying different components for different URLs.\nRouting is usually achieved in React with a library such as React Router. You can find more information about this library with examples here.\nExercise: Use React Router\nHomeWork\nContinue building last week's app. As we get familiar with retrieving data and displaying it, we take our project into the next step.\nWe want to break the app into different pages which the users can navigate around (with the Back/Forward button or typing a url) without losing context.\nThe App will consist of three pages:\n\nHome: displays a list of all areas (url: / )\nArea: shows the organisations in a specific area (url: /area/{areaName} )\nOrganisation View: shows once specific organisation information (url: /organisations/{organisationName})\n\nIn order to implement this behaviour, we will use React-Router library.\nBonus:\n\nImplement a fuzzy search functionality in the Area page where users can search by name or website etc..\nUse a library called underscore, find it online, read its documentation and npm install it.

Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other commitments to be here.

We are hosted by generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!) to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in English!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and finding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help but do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the best ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community.
