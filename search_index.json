Technology Survey from\nStackOverflow. Pay\nparticular attention to the technologies we'll be teaching you (JavaScript,\nReact, NodeJS)\n\n\nHouse Rules\nHow we work?\nHow we treat each other?\n\n\nStandup\n\nWelcome!\nWelcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of Web Development! Now that you have\nbuilt a website in CodePen and learned the basics of HTML and CSS, it's time to\nlearn about the tools that web developers use in their everyday job. These tools\nwill be used during the course, so it is important that you become familiarised\nwith them.\nIn order to get started, we would like you to try to complete a task at home:\nmove your CodePen website to a web address under\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name.\nIn the process, you will learn how to store your code outside CodePen's website,\nin a location where other developers can make changes to it and view a history\nof all the updates that you have made.\nIf you wish to learn more about the concepts behind the steps we are suggesting\nbelow, please read the rest of this document.\nAnd remember: it's ok if you are stuck and don't know how to continue. At any\npoint, please ask for a mentor's help. We will cover these steps again in the\nlesson, and will explain them in more detail.\nHow to move your website to Github.io\n\nExport your website as a zip from CodePen.\nHelp >\nExtract the contents of the zip file to a folder in your computer. Keep note\nof the location of this folder.\nRead about the terminal.\nRead about git.\nInstall Git.\nPut the contents of the zip folder in a Gitub repository.\nHow does Github work? (30min) >\nYou should now have a page with your code under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name. This is a view of\nyour code, and you should see a list of your files, including an\nindex.html.\nNow all that remains is to publish your website! Still under\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name, find the settings\nicon in the top right corner.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nFind the section named \"Github Pages\" and select \"master branch\" in source,\nthen hit \"Save\".\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWait a few minutes, then refresh the page and come back to the Github Pages\nsection. You should see a green bar saying \"Your site is published at\nhttp://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name\". Click the link,\nverify that your website is there, then share it with your CYF class!\n\nTerminal basics\nDuring your course journey and onwards, the terminal (also known as\ncommand line) will be one of your most valuable tools. It will help you to\ninteract with you computer faster, by helping you to:\n\nCreate and delete files.\nInstall web development tools.\nStart a server.\nUse source control (explained later in this lesson).\n\nAll this will make sense as we progress with the lessons. For now, we would like\nyou to get familiar with it by following this tutorial:\n\nLearn the command line >\n\nHow do I use it on my computer?\nSo now that you know what the terminal can do for you, how do you use it? Please\nfind instructions for your operating system below. After you have followed the\ninstructions, open a terminal and write ls, then press the Enter key. You\nwill see something like this:\n\n  \n\n\nCommonly used commands\nThere's a set of commands you should become comfortable with during the course to allow you to effectively move around the filesystem and write software on your laptop.\n\ncd - change directory. To move up into the parent directory use: cd ..\nls - list the contents of a directory. Can also be used as ls [directory_name] to list the contents of a specific directory without actually moving (with cd) to it\npwd - print the full location of your current directory\nmkdir [name] - create a new directory, with the given name after a space\ntouch [file_name] - create a new file, with the given name (don't forget to add the extension, like .css or .html)\nrm [file_name] - remove a file\nrm -r [directory_name] - remove a directory (and all files inside that directory)\n\nLinux\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nmacOS (Apple)\nThe Terminal is already installed. It should be in the list of applications\navailable in your computer.\nMore instructions >\nWindows\nInstall Git. It will bring with it a tool\ncalled \"Git Bash\". When the mentors ask you to open a terminal or command line,\nplease open \"Git Bash\".\nGit\nWe will use Git as our Version Control System (also known as Source Control).\nIt's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!\n\nWhat is \"version control\"? Version control is a system that records\nchanges to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific\nversions later.\nIt allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire\nproject back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last\nmodified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue\nand when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things\nup or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for\nvery little overhead.\nExtract from\nGit Pro book\n\nThis answer on StackOverflow by\nsi618 explains very well why we\nuse Version Control.\nSo what is Git? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use,\nand by far\nthe most popular.\nWhat is Github? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and\nshare your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.\nGet Started\nFollow this tutorial from Github to setup Git\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/\nThen\nlearn how to use git from the Terminal >\nTry completing this tutorial > as well to learn more\nintermediate features, like branching.\nA typical workflow\n\nIf you're basing your work from another project, the first step is typically\nto fork their repo. Read this guide for instructions\n(https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n\nIf you're starting a new project then you should follow these steps\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/\n\n\nUsing Git through the Terminal\n\ngit init if it is a new project, i.e. a project not cloned from a\nrepo (or a fork of a repo)\ngit add . to add local files to the index\ngit commit -m \"Good explanation of your file changes\" to commit files to the\nlocal repo\ngit remote add origin GitRepoRemoteUrl if it is a new project (to\nsetup the remote url)\ngit remote -v to verify that the remote url is set correctly\ngit push -u origin master to push your commits to the remote url (Github in\nour case)\n\nYou will also typically need to set up your email and name once when you install\nGit git config --global user.name  and `git config --global user.email\n`.\nUsing Git through a graphical interface\nIf you don't feel comfortable with the terminal just yet, download the\nGithub client. If possible, however, we\nrecommend becoming comfortable with the Terminal commands and understanding the\nsteps for the different workflows before moving on to visual Git clients.\nGithub client guides >\nPull Requests\nYou should also learn how to create and work with\nPull Requests.\nGithub\nDuring our course, we will be using Github to store our\ncode. Github is the most popular Git service around, and is used by many large\ncompanies, like Facebook, Airbnb and The Guardian.\nCodeYourFuture's Github page >\nMore Resources\n\nFollow this tutorial to learn the basic Git commands\nhttps://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git\nAnother good resource: Git - the simple guide\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\nA more detailed tutorial that goes into advanced topics of Git -\nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control\nYou can also check this visual explanation of different commands and what they\ndo: http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=workspace\nThere are GUI software - Gitkraken is one of them https://www.gitkraken.com/\nThis Glossary has definitions of the terms normally used with Git:\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n\nIDE\nIDE stands for \"Integrated Development Environment\". It is the software that you\nwill be using to write most of your code. It is designed to help you develop\nyour apps quickly, focusing on the problems that you need to solve instead of\nhaving to search Google for minor details.\nAuto-complete\nOne of the most important features of an IDE is that it provides\n\"auto-completion\". This means that it will give you suggestions of what you can\ncan write next, while you are typing something.\nFor example, when writing a CSS property, it will tell you what values you can\nassign it to.\n\n  \n\n\nFile tree view\nThe reason why we call it \"Integrated\" is that you almost don't need to leave\nthe window to write your app. For example, creating, renaming and moving files\ncan be done directly from the IDE. This functionality can be achieved from\nsomething called a \"Tree view\", which you can usually find on the left side of\nyour IDE.\n\n  \n\n\nFinding files\nWhen working with big projects, you will often need to find a file quickly,\nwithout having to go through the tree view manually.\n\n  \n\n\nMost IDEs will allow you to do this with a sequence of keys.\nVSCode sequence: Windows/Linux Ctrl + P | Mac Cmd + P\nInstall an IDE\nFor this course, we recommend the usage of\nVS Code. Please go ahead and install it, then\ntry opening an HTML file with it via File > Open.\nInstall VS Code >\nOther IDEs\nBesides VS Code, the IDEs below are also popular with web developers. Feel free\nto check out their websites and see the differences between them and VS Code.\n\nAtom\nWebstorm\n\nHomework\n\nIf you have not yet moved your website from CodePen to Github, do it now.\nPlease use the information in this section to complete it.\nWhen your website is live at https://your-username.github.io/your-site-name,\nplease send a link to the slack channel of your class.\nLearn how to navigate your computer using a Terminal (view files, copy files).\nInstall VS Code.\nOpen your website with VS Code and add something to it: text, images, update\nCSS. Commit your changes to Github and verify that\nhttps://your-username.github.io/your-site-name has been updated!\n\nIt's alright if you are getting stuck or if something doesn't look right! When\nit happens, please ask your mentors or classmates for help in Slack.\n"},"house-rules.html":{"url":"house-rules.html","title":"House Rules","keywords":"","body":"House Rules\n\nWhilst you're a student, arrive on time. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make the class possible and giving up other commitments to be here. Respect that, and always be on time.\n\nLeave our space cleaner and tidier than when we arrive. We are hosted by generous folks who are offering their space (and time) to help us - the least we can do is to keep their space tidy and clean, and consider it our own.\n\nCommunication is key (and in English). Setup Slack on your phone and computer, and use it all the time to ask and provide help, enquire about the classes etc... Also, the classes help lots of the students (and volunteers!) to improve their English as a nice side effect, so even if you share a language with some of the participants, resist the temptation and speak in English!\n\nLearn to find answers. A big part of what we teach you is about researching and finding answers by yourself - get in the habit of Googling and finding answers to your questions.\n\nAlways be in control of the keyboard and mouse. Don't let the mentors take control of your keyboard and mouse, don't let them type for you, ask for help but do things yourself!\n\nHelp each other. As students, you're the most qualified to help each other, as you're going through the same journey of learning - offer and ask for help from your fellow students (helping someone else is also one of the best ways to improve your own skills)\n\nWe are a community. This project is special (it's more than just a coding school) and it belongs to all of us: students, mentors, volunteers and friends of CYF. Embrace it like that, be proactive about helping it grow and succeed in all of its aspects.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nOur project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, nationality, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof) etc... We do not tolerate harassment of the project's members (mentors, students, volunteers etc...) in any form. Anyone violating these rules may be expelled from the course, at the discretion of CodeYourFuture.\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\nVerbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, nationality etc...\nSexual images in public spaces\nDeliberate intimidation, stalking, or following\nHarassing photography or recording\nSustained disruption of talks or other events\nInappropriate physical contact\nUnwelcome sexual attention\nAdvocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour\n\n"},"html-css/":{"url":"html-css/","title":"HTML/CSS","keywords":"","body":"HTML & CSS\n\n\n\nWeeks\nContent\n\n\n\n\nweek-01\nSemantic HTML tags .

(Wikipedia)\n\nPrinciples - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.\n\nHTML Syntax\nYou're already familiar with HTML code from your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this quick guide to the HTML syntax.\nAll together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:\n\n    Learning HTML\n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\n\nExercise Which parts are the Tags and which parts are the Attributes.\n\nHTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called \"nesting\" tags or creating an HTML \"tree\". Between the opening  tag and the closing  tag there are three other tags. We call these \"child\" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.\n\n\nExercise As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.\n\n\n    Learning HTML\n    \n        Author:\n        Code Your Future\n    \n    Get to know the HTML basics.\n    Read Article\n\n\nExample HTML/CSS Project\nIn today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe example website you'll begin working with is available on this GitHub repository. Fork the repository to your personal account and use the following terminal commands to download the files to your projects folder.\n\ncd ~\ncd \ngit clone git@github.com:/bikes-for-refugees.git\n\n\nExercise: Spend a few minutes exploring the .html and .css files for this page. Why don't we put everything in one file?\n\nSemantic HTML\nWhen writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.\n\nSemantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Wikipedia\n\nWe'll cover the following semantic tags:\n\n\n\nThe role=\"main\" attribute\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to determine where to place these new Tags and Attributes in the index.html file. Who benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\n\nCSS Selectors\nDuring your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.\n\nIf you want to review the selectors, read the Common Selectors section of this page.\nExercise (pair programming): Work in pairs to make the blue buttons on the page red (#ce5f31). The white button, which says \"Volunteer\", should remain white but the text should change to red.\n\nPseudo Classes\nYou can assign CSS rules to a class like this:\n.btn {\n    background: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nThere are also things called \"pseudo\" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.\n\n\"pseudo\" is a fancy word for \"fake\". We call them \"pseudo\" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.\n\nHere's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.\n.btn:hover {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\nNot everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit tab to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the :focus pseudo class too.\n.btn:hover,\n.btn:focus {\n    background: #ef7f52;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the pseudo classes to make the background color of the red buttons change when in a \"hover\" or \"focus\" state. See if you can make the white \"Volunteer\" button change to a different background without effecting the red buttons.\n\nBox Model\nIn CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.\n\n\nExercise: Work in pairs and use the margin and padding rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.\n\nYou may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.\nYou can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.\n.navlink {\n    border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n\n\nExercise: Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.\n\nGit Conflicts\nAs a professional, you'll usually need to work alongside other coders to build an app or website. We use version control to coordinate changes and manage any conflicts that arise. Git is a version control system which helps us merge code that we've been working on separately into one common codebase.\nTo manage conflicts, we will need a common code base in which all changes are coordinated. When working on our own, we'll make our changes in branches to keep the code separate. Then we'll learn how to refresh your individual branch with the common code base, and prepare your changes to be merged.\n\nExercise: Get together in pairs and select a \"leader\". The leader should fork this repository to their GitHub account. The other person should then fork the leader's repository. Both students should then clone their own personal forks locally.\n\nNow that you have the project set up on your computer, you need a place to safely make changes without effecting the common code base. To do this, we'll navigate to our project in the Terminal and create a new branch:\ncd \ngit checkout -b my-first-branch\n\nWhen you commit changes on this branch, your changes will be saved separately from the common code base. This way both team members can make changes at the same time.\n\nExercise: Add your name and a sentence about yourself to the index.html file. Then git add and git commit to commit to your personal branch.\n\nNow you have two branches: master and my-first-branch. These branches have diverged, which means you have changes in one that don't appear in the other. You can check this by running git checkout master, then looking at your index.html file.\nWhen you're done, run git checkout my-first-branch to go back to the branch with your changes. Git saves your changes in both branches and lets you switch between them. That's why we call it \"version control\". It saves different versions so you can switch between them.\nRight now, your new branch only exists on your computer. Let's push it up to GitHub so you can see it in your profile.\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit push -u origin my-first-branch\n\nNow both students in each pair, the \"leader\" and the other student, should have branches with changes. Now let's try to merge these changes together into the \"leader's\" master branch.\n\nExercise: Browse to the \"leader's\" GitHub repository and open a new Pull Request. The Pull Request should ask to merge your my-first-branch branch into the \"leader's\" master branch. Ask a mentor for help if you have trouble figuring out how to issue a Pull Request. When both students have issued a Pull Request to the correct place, merge one of them but not the other.\n\nCongrats, you've merged one student's changes with the common code base in the master branch. If you check the other Pull Request, you'll see you have a problem. It can't be merged automatically because there's a conflict. Why?\nConflicts emerge whenever the same file has been edited, and git can't determine what changes should be kept and what changes should be discarded. A human -- that's you -- needs to step in and sort it out. To help us, git writes into our code so we can see where it is confused. Here's an example of a merge conflict in our code:\nMozafar\n+   I am a mentor at CodeYourFuture.\n=======\n-   Daniel\n-   I like to ride bikes\n>>>>>>> my-first-branch\n\nTo resolve a conflict, we decide which lines to keep and which lines to remove. When we're done, we remove the extra lines that git added (, ======== and >>>>>>>).\nLet's see how we can resolve this conflict with your branches. First we need to fetch the latest changes from the leader's master branch. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, you need to set up the remote and pull from that master:\ngit checkout master\ngit remote add upstream \ngit pull upstream master\n\nNow everyone's master branch should include the Pull Request that was merged. Whichever student still needs to get their Pull Request merged can bring those changes into their branch like this:\ngit checkout my-first-branch\ngit merge master\n\nYou probably received a merge conflict.\n\nExercise: Follow the steps we discussed before about how to resolve a merge conflict by editing the file. Make sure both students changes are included in the final version. When you're done, use git add, git commit and git push to share your changes with GitHub. If everything has gone correctly, you can now merge the Pull Request.\n\nNow everyone can sync their changes. If you're the leader, just do:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n\nIf you're the other student, do this:\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master\n\n\nExercise: As a group, discuss why the git pull command is different for the leader and the other student.\nExercise: Try to do the pull requests again, but this time switch the pull requests so that the other student must manage the merge conflict.\n\nIf you're feeling confused, don't worry. Version control is one of the most difficult things you'll learn and we'll be going over it again and again and again.\nResources\n\nHTML5 - semantic elements\nCSS Selectors - MDN\nThe Cascade - MDN\nBox Model - MDN\nBox Model, box-sizing: border-box - CSS Tricks\nCSS specificity - MDN\nPseudo classes - MDN\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 2 hours) Read about advanced CSS selectors and then practice by playing this CSS selector game.

To ensure we're presenting a website that's easy to use on any device, we use Responsive Web Design techniques to modify how content is displayed depending on the viewport.\n\nExercise: As a group, let's brainstorm as many devices as we can think of which might access the websites we build.\n\nSee how much variety there is in viewport sizes.\nMedia Queries\nAs you learned in your homework assignment, media queries help us change the display of our content depending on the size of the viewport. Let's review what you learned and break down a media query:\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  body {\n    background: red;\n  }\n}\n\nIn this media query, we're assigning a red background color to the  element whenever the viewport is larger than 900px, and we're viewing on a screen.\n\n@media starts the media query\nscreen tells it to apply these styles to screen displays. Other displays\nmight be print, for when a webpage is being printed.\n(min-width: 900px) tells it to apply these styles when the viewport is\nlarger than 900px\n\nFinally, we wrap all of our styles for this media query in brackets ({ and }), just like a CSS rule.\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, reduce the size of the \"Bikes for Refugees\" text so that it fits on a small screen (320px). But make sure it increases in size on larger screens.\nExercise: The two buttons in the jumbotron don't fit on the same line on small screens around 320px wide. Can you adjust their size so that they fit on the same line?\n\nFlexbox\nFlexbox is a name for a set of CSS layout rules which are supported in newer browsers. They allow you to apply rules to elements to place them side-by-side and re-arrange them. You just specify how you want your elements arranged and the browser will scale this arrangement depending on the screen size and device used for viewing.\nMost flexbox rules are applied to the container, to tell it how to arrange its children. However, there are some rules that can be applied to children as well.\nYou can see all the rules that can be applied to both the container and the children here:\nhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\n\nExercise: Continue editing the \"Bike for refugees\" website by adding 3 boxes below Jumbotron, and using Flexbox, make sure they are arranged like in the sketch below:\n\n\nYou can start with something like the below, by just adding a container, and the 3 text pieces within it. Try to use flexbox to position the text elements within the container to match the picture:\n  \n    Check availability \n    Donate bikes \n    Volunteer with us \n \n\nOnce that's done you can move on to creating boxes for each individual text piece, and again, using flexbox to position the text piece in the middle of its box.\n\nLet's take a break from flexbox for a minute. Do you remember the :first-child psuedo class? There's a :last-child psuedo class as well.\n\nExercise: See if you can use these psuedo classes to give the left box a grey background (#ddd) and the right box a grey border (1px solid #ddd). Use this screenshot to guide you.\n\nHomework\n\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the \"Common Responsive Patterns\" lesson of the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Complete as many levels of the Flexbox Froggy game as you can. This will stretch your knowledge of Flexbox and you may need to do some research. It's ok if you can't complete all levels. Do as many as you can.\n(Est. 3 hours) Complete as many levels as you can from Flexbox Zombies\n(Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.\n(Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about positioning content in CSS using floats and absolute positioning.\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\n(Est. 1 hour) You may remember Bootstrap from your application process.

It is sometimes called a \"design system\", \"style guide\", or \"pattern library\", and will usually consist of three things:\n\nBrand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.\nComponents define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.\nHelpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.\n\nThe main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.\nBootstrap 4\nBootstrap is CSS and JavaScript code that we load in our HTML pages. Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a grid layout as well as several components.\n\nExercise: Fork this repository and follow the instructions in the readme to create a new page and add a card component to it.\nExercise: Perform a group exercise exploring the git workspace. Then create a branch, commit your new page, and issue a pull request. Once all the pull requests are merged, switch back to the master branch and update your copy.\n\nDid you know there are other open-source HTML/CSS frameworks you can try? Two popular ones are Bulma and Foundation.\nPersonal Websites\nOver the last two weeks, you've been building personal websites as part of your homework. Now we want you to take those websites and apply the knowledge you've learned to make them as good as you can. Some ideas:\n\nAdd Bootstrap 4 to your site and use some of the components.\nUse re-usable class names to reduce your CSS code.\nValidate your HTML code to find and fix problems.\nAdd a second page and link to it from your first page.\nTry to style the first article differently so that it stands out from the rest.\n\nBy the end, you should have created a repository for your site on GitHub with all the commits you've made.\nRetrospective\nAt the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective.

You can find the full instructions, if necessary,\nhere.\nA note on security: don't execute a script on your terminal if you don't\ntrust its source, especially if they use the sudo command to get admin\naccess to your machine.\n\nTo test that it was installed and that it's running properly, go to your\nterminal and run the command: node -v You should get the node version printed\non your terminal, for example, v8.9.3\n\nFork the\njs-exercises\nrepository and Clone it locally.\n\n\nHello World\nIt is programming tradition that the first thing you do in any language is make\nit output \"Hello world!\". This is the first thing we'll do in JavaScript, using\nsomething called a console.log().\nconsole.log()\nWhen we ran the command node main.js - that did log to the console\nprinting the words Hello World to the terminal.\nLet's open the file main.js and investigate its contents\n\nExercises\n\nWhat do you notice about the code? Anything you don't understand? Notice the\nsemicolon, the dot, the parentheses - these are all elements of JavaScript\nSyntax\n\nTry to console.log() something different, for example, Hello World. I just started learning JavaScript!. (run node main.js after each change\nand look at the output in the console)\n\nTry to console.log() several things at once.\nWhat happens when you get rid of the quote marks?\nWhat happens when you console.log() just a number without quotes?\n\n\nNode\nWe ran our JavaScript using Node - Node is is an open-source, cross-platform\nJavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.\nWikipedia\n\nExercises What are other \"places\" where we can run JavaScript code?\n\nComments\nYou can add comments to help you and others understand your code - use // to\nadd a comment and everything you write until the end of the line will be ignored\nby the program.\nIf you need to comment more than one line, you can use /* and */ at the\nstart and at the end of the commented block of text.\n// This is a comment for myself and other developers to understand the next line of code\nconsole.log(\"Hello world!\");\n\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\"); // comments can also be in the same line like this\n/*\nI can also make comments\nover more than one line if necessary\n*/\nconsole.log(\"Hello World\");\n\n\nExercises What are the comments in that main.js script.\n\nData Types\nIf you played around with console.log() in the last step, you might have\nnoticed that words always have to be inside quotes or else the code breaks,\nwhereas numbers can work without quotes. Why is this? Well these are different\ndata types in JavaScript. You'll need to learn the three main data types to\nget started coding (later we'll look at some other data types, like objects and\narrays).\nStrings\nStrings are simple text, ranging anywhere from a single character to lengthy\nparagraphs. A string is always written inside a pair of quotes (single or\ndouble).\n\"node girls\";\n\nNumbers\nNumbers do not need to be wrapped in quotes like strings, and can just be\nwritten as is.\n100; // an integer number\n100.89; // a decimal number (floating point)\n\nBooleans\nThere is a special data type in JavaScript known as a \"boolean\" value. A boolean\nis either true or false, and it should be written without quotes.\ntrue;\n\nYou've seen what they look like, now make sure they are what you think they are.\nThere is a built-in feature in JavaScript which allows you to check the type of\na particular value: typeof.\nWrite this code in your main.js, and run it (using node main.js in the\nterminal):\nconsole.log(typeof \"Hello world!\");\n\nYou should see string printed to the console.\n\nExercise Now try that three times, once for each data type. Log the\ntypeof for three different values: \"Code Your Future\", 6 and false.\nYou should get different output for each one.\n\nVariables\nWhen you code, you'll want to create shortcuts so you can easily refer to\nthings without writing out the same value every time. In JavaScript we have\nvariables, which allow us to store values to use later.\n\nThink of variables names like labels on boxes, while the value of the\nvariable are the contents of the box - you could change the contents of a\nbox and leave the label intact, the contents of the boxes can have different\ntypes, the boxes should have good labels (a box of books being labeled pens\nwould be very confusing),\n\nPhoto from\nKhan Academy\n\nTry it out\nYou create a variable using the keyword var, which lets the application know\nthat you're about to store a value. You also have to give a name to your\nvariable, which can be anything you like, so long as it doesn't include spaces.\nHere's an example of creating a variable called \"city\", which is storing a\nstring called \"Glasgow\".\nWe use the equal sign, =, to assign the string \"Glasgow\" as a value of our\nvariable city. the Equal sign, in this case, is called an 'operator'.\nvar city = \"Glasgow\";\nconsole.log(city);\n\nYou'll notice that once you've created the variable, you can then simply write\nthe name of the variable wherever you want to refer to it, rather than writing\nout Glasgow every time. You don't put quotes around a variable name.\nTry to run the above code, and see what is printed to the console.\n\nExercise\nIn the above example, what will happen if we change the second line to\nconsole.log(\"city\") - Do you notice the difference? What do you think will\nbe the output?\n\nYou should have some code left over from previous steps which looks something\nlike this (maybe even with comments):\nconsole.log(typeof \"Code Your Future\");\nconsole.log(typeof 6);\nconsole.log(typeof false);\n\n\nExercise: Now that you know how to create variables, rewrite this code.\nThis time, define these values as variables at the top of the file, create a\nvariable called courseName and assign it the value Code Your Future. Then create a variable called courseDuration and assign it the value\n6, and a variable called isHard and assign it the value false.\nRefer to the three variables that you just created to get their types (i.e.\nconsole.log(typeof courseName) etc...)\nIs your output the same?\n\nSemicolons\nYou might have noticed that we add a semicolon ; at the end of each line.\nThis is part of the Javascript language syntax, and it's used to separate\ndifferent commands.\nNot ending the commands with a ; might still work most of the time, as the\nJavascript language is quite permissive and will try to interpret the code\nanyway.\nThat said, always remember to put the semicolon at the end of each\ncommand as it's considered \"best practice\" by the wider developer community,\nit allows to avoid some hard-to-spot problems and help to avoid confusion.\nConditionals\nNow we're going to start adding in some logic. So far we have been logging\nthe same thing every time we run the code, but what if we want to log according\nto different conditions? In programming there is something called an \"if/else\nstatement\". It tests conditions, and will perform different actions based on the\noutcome of these tests.\nThe structure of an if/else statement in JavaScript is as follows:\nif (condition) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\nIt basically translates to \"if this condition is true, do this - or else do\nsomething else\".\nTry it out\nWhat if we want to console.log() \"Hello world!\" if we're feeling happy, and\nsomething else if we're sad?\nLet's define a variable called isHappy, and assign it a boolean value of\ntrue or false (depending on how happy you're feeling).\nvar isHappy = true;\n\nThen let's write our if/else statement. In our condition, we want to test if the\nvariable isHappy is equal to true.\nThis is a comparison operation, and we need a comparison operator to do so.\nIn Javascript, the operator we need is a triple equal sign, ===.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // do something\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n\n\nNote: Remember that (as we've seen in the Variables section) a\nsingle = is used to assign a value instead. A common mistake is to use =\ninstead of === inside a if statement, so always remember to check.\n\nNow let's add in what will happen if the conditions are met. The comments are\nthere to explain what is happening.\nif (isHappy === true) {\n  // if I am happy, print \"Hello world!\"\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n} else {\n  // if I am sad, print a frowny face\n  console.log(\":(\");\n}\n\nNow run this code and see what happens! Try changing the value of your variable\nfrom true to false.\nWe now know the equal === comparison operator. Javascript give us a number of\nthem to compare different variables. A list them can be found here and in the Resources at the bottom of this page.\n\nExercise\nWrite an if/else statement that evaluates if a number is even or odd. If it is\neven, it will print the string 'even', and if it is odd, it will print\n'odd'.\nFor this challenge, you might find it useful to use the \"modulo\" operator,\nwhich looks like this: %. The modulo operator finds the remainder after\ndivision of one number by another. For example:\n13 % 2 === 1; // 13 divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1\n100 % 10 === 0; // 100 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 0\n\nExercise\nNow improve your code so that it prints out if the number is positive or\nnegative, as well as even or odd. For example, for -5 it will print\n'negative odd', while for 4 it will print 'positive even'.\nHint: You can use the > or  signs. Check the list of comparison\noperators provided before the Exercise to learn what they do.\nIf you finish early, think about how you would test your code works correctly?\n\nLoops\nCoding is great because it makes it easy to automate boring tasks, like writing\nthe same thing over and over again. A \"for loop\" lets you do that in\nJavaScript. \"For loops\" let you perform the same operation a certain number of\ntimes, each time with a different value.\nA for loop has the following syntax:\nfor (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nStatement 1 defines a variable for the loop and assigns it a starting value.\nIt is usually a number, which will increase each time the loop completes an\niteration. We can use this number inside the loop to keep track of where we're\nat. You can set the number to be whatever you want initially.\nvar i = 0;\n\nStatement 2 defines how long the loop will go on for (what needs to happen\nfor the loop to stop running?). It most often uses the less than () or less\nthan or equal to () operators to set the length.\ni \nStatement 3 defines by how much to increment the i variable each time the\nloop completes an iteration. If you just want it to increase by one, then put\ni++, or else you can increase by other numbers like so:\ni += 2;\n\nInside the square brackets goes the code you wish to be executed each time the\nloop runs. You can refer to the variable i from inside the loop.\nTry it out\nHere's an example of an actual for loop that prints out the numbers 1 to 10:\nfor (var i = 1; i \nNotice the variable i is set to 1, because we want counting to begin there.\nThe length is set to be less than or equal to 10, as we want the loop to end\nthere. And we are increasing the value of i by one each time.\n\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that loops over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing only\nevery second number. So it should return 2, 4, 6, 8, 10....\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out all the numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by 5.\nSee if you can think or more than one way to solve this.\nExercise\nWrite a for loop that prints out the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 100.\n\nFunctions\nWe've been writing code that performs different actions, but sometimes you want\nto group code together to achieve a particular end. This is where functions come\nin.\nA function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function\nis executed when it is \"invoked\".\nThe syntax of a function looks like this:\nfunction functionName(parameters) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nYou can call a function whatever you want, just like a variable. You can also\ngive a function different values every time you run it which are called\n\"parameters\".\nTo make the function run, we invoke it like so:\nfunctionName();\n\nTry it out\nLet's write a function that adds two numbers together. We'll call it add. We\nwant to add together two different numbers every time, so let's define two\nparameters to represent this, x and y.\nfunction add(x, y) {\n  // code to be executed\n}\n\nadd(2, 3);\n\nNotice we have invoked the function underneath, with the parameters 2 and 3.\nInside the function, try to console.log() your parameters and see what\nhappens.\nNow, we want to add these two numbers together, but it isn't enough just to\nwrite x + y, since we haven't told the function to return anything. It's time\nfor a return statement. The return statement specifies the value to output.\nfunction add(x, y) {\n  return x + y;\n}\nadd(2, 3);\n\nRun this code, and hopefully you get the right answer!\n\nExercise\nWrite a function called multiply that multiplies two numbers together. It\nshould take two numbers as parameters and return the answer.\nExercise\nGo back and copy the code to your previous solution for printing the sum of\nnumbers between 1 and 100. Put this code inside a function. Change the\nfunction so it accepts any two limits and prints the sum of all the numbers\nbetween those limits.\nFor example: addBetween(1,3) should print 6\n\nResources\n\nData Types\nComparison Operators\nArithmetic Operators\n\nHomework\n\nThe repo that you\nhave forked during this class contains few challenges - solve them in\nJavaScript!\n\nFollow\nthis course\non Khan Academy.

They are also mutable, which means that values\ninside them can be changed, added and removed.\nThe syntax for an array is a number of variables separated by commas, with\nsquare brackets and the start and end.\n[\"Bill\", \"Marta\", \"Andrew\"][(1, 53, 135, 6, 2)][ // an array of 3 strings // an array of 5 integers\n  (\"Hello world\", 98, true, \"Rachel\")\n]; // an array containing different data types\n\nvar myArrayOfFriends = [\"Bill\", \"Marta\", \"Andrew\"]; // assigning the array to a variable\n\nInteracting with the array\nAn array data type is only useful if we can interact with the values stored\nwithin. Like other data type, arrays in Javascript have a number of methods\nalready defined to make our life easier.\nLet's start by defining an array of animals!\nvar animals = [\"tiger\", \"puppy\", \"snake\", \"llama\"];\n\nPretty neat! Now you have all the animals grouped together rather than having to\ndefine them separately. One of the useful methods that we get from arrays lets\nus check the number of values present in it by accessing the length attribute.\nWe do that with a ., like so:\nconsole.log(animals.length); // 4\n\nWe have the length, but how do you access a single value inside?\nUsing an index!\nAn index is an integer, such as 0, 1, 2, etc. It indicates the\nposition of the values inside the array. As is common in many programming\nlanguages, indices in JavaScript arrays start with 0 --- so 0 is\nthe index of the first element of an Array, 1 is the index of the second\nelement, and so forth.\nIf you want to refer to one specific member of the array, you can do so by using\ntheir 'index number' like so:\nconsole.log(animals[1]); // Guess the output before running the command!\n\n\nTake a guess at which animal that will print out, and see if you're right.\n\nSpoiler alert, it will print out 'puppy'. That might seem weird, until you\nremember the paragraph just before the example: arrays in Javascript are\n0-indexed, which means that the first value is accessed with animals[0] :\nconsole.log(animals[0]); // 'tiger'\nconsole.log(animals[1]); // 'puppy'\nconsole.log(animals[2]); // 'snake'\nconsole.log(animals[3]); // 'llama'\nconsole.log(animals[4]); // undefined! the array has 4 elements, animal[5] would try to access the 5th!\n\n\nExercise:\n1 Create an array that contains the countries of all the students in the\nclass (at least five nationalities)\n2 console.log the number of countries in the Array\n3 Now, console.log() each country in the list\n4 Update point 3 to work for arrays of any length (hint: use for loops and the length property)\nExtra points: Don't ask a mentor - Google it! Try googling to find the answer if you're\nstuck. Google skills are an essential part of being a developer.\n\nObjects\nNow for the final data type: objects. Like arrays, they can store multiple bits\nof information, except objects store the properties of something. For example,\nyou might want to save the name, model and colour of a car. Or the name, time\nand location of a film playing at the cinema.\nThe syntax looks like this:\n{\n  property1: 'value1',\n  property2: 'value2',\n  property3: 'value3'\n}\n\nThe names on the left ('property1') are known 'keys'. Any values can be given to\nthem: strings, booleans, integers.\nTry it out\nLet's define an object that represents a person:\nvar person = {\n  firstName: \"Nelson\",\n  lastName: \"Mandela\",\n  occupation: \"freedom fighter\",\n  age: 95,\n  alive: false\n};\n\nWe can console.log() the entire object, but you can also reference just one of\nthe properties. Run this code:\nconsole.log(person.firstName);\n\n\nExercise Using an object representing a person, console.log() a sentence\nintroducing the person. Print out the following:\n'Hi, my name is {firstName} {lastName}. I am {age} years old, and work as a\n{occupation}.'\nHint: you can construct longer strings by adding them together. This includes\nvariables. For example:\nvar name = \"Jane\";\nconsole.log(\"People call me \" + name);\n\n// the previous line will print\n// 'People call me Jane'\n\n\nUseful array methods\nConcatenating two arrays\nYou've learned how you can add two numbers and append two strings, but how does\nthis work for arrays? A simple arr1 + arr2 will not do, but there is a method\nyou can use: concat(). It is a method that you call on the array (similar to\nhow console.log is the log function called on console) and takes the array\nyou want to append as a parameter.\nvar countries = [\"Scotland\", \"Germany\", \"Syria\"];\nvar moreCountries = [\"Sudan\", \"Ethiopia\", \"France\"];\n\ncountries.concat(moreCountries);\nconsole.log(countries); // ['Scotland', 'Germany', 'Syria', 'Sudan', 'Ethiopia', 'France']\n\nAppending an element\nIf you want to append an element to an array, you can just put it after the last\nexisting element like so:\ncountries[countries.length] = \"United States of America\";\n\nThere is another way though, which is a bit more elegant: the push function.\ncountries.push(\"United States of America\");\n\n// .push can also be called with multiple parameters\ncountries.push(\"United States of America\", \"France\");\n\n\nExercise: Search .slice, .splice and .pop and tell us what they do\n\nResources\n\nArrays\nObjects\nStrings\n\nHomework\nChallenges\nGo back to the repo\nthat you have forked during the last class:\n\nIf you haven't attempted all the week 1 base challenges, go back and work on \nthem!\nIf you're all done, challenge yourself with the week 1 advanced challenges, \nand the ones present in week 2.\n\nCode style and best practices\nAs you might have noticed, there are often several valid ways to write the\nsame code.\nFor example we can define a string with either single or double:\nquotes:\nvar singleQuotes = 'Hello';\nvar doubleQuotes = \"Hello\";  // exactly the same as singleQuotes\n\n// check if they're actually the same\nsingleQuotes == doubleQuotes  // true\n\nAnother example, on spacing and newlines:\nfunction sayHello() {\n  return 'Hello world!';\n}\n\n// is the same as\nfunction sayHello (){\n  return 'Hello world!';\n}\n\n// or\nfunction sayHello()\n{\n  return 'Hello world!';\n}\n\n// and even\nfunction sayHello(){return 'Hello world!';}\n\nWhile functionally the same, good developer are consistent in the way they\nwrite their code.\nConsistency and predictability in the visual structure of the code won't\nchange the way the computer will execute the code, but will make it way easier\nto maintain the code and spot bugs for both you and other programmers.\nTo this end, many organisation and people develop a set of conventions ,\nor style guide on how to structure their code. While often one option is not strictly 'better' than others, it is tremendously helpful if all the people\nworking on a project write in the same style.\nTo get some more insight on the argument, read these links:\n\nhttps://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/why-coding-style-matters/ dig a bit \nmore on the why a style guide is a good thing. The publishing date is old and \nthe resources are mostly outdated, but the article itself is still very good.\nhttps://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/css-documentation-best-practices--cms-30139 \na recent article by a UX designer sharing tips on how she organise her css.\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es5-deprecated/es5 and \nhttps://github.com/airbnb/css, the official airbnb styleguides for JavaScript \nand css. Two notes here: first, just skim these. Like a foreign language \ndictionary, a beginner can have the most benefit using it as a reference rather \nthan memorising it in its entirety. Second: the 'es5' link is deprecated as \nairbnb uses 'es6', which is a version of JavaScript with new syntax which you \nwill learn in the future.\nhttps://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding. This is sometime mentioned to \nrefer to developer spending huge amount of time fighting on which style of code \nis 'better'\nbbc styleguide. Styleguides are not only about code, \nbut they are used for book writing, communication, and design.\n\nCode Testing\nThe styleguide section introduced us to the concept of 'maintainability' of our\ncode, which is the ability of going back to it at a later date and change it,\nimprove it of fix bugs.\nAs a project's size grows and more people work on it, it becomes more and more\ncomplicated, and it's increasingly difficult for developers, especially juniors,\nto have a mental map of every single line of code. Every change on the codebase\nrisks breaking the functionality in unexpected ways leading to a never-ending\nloop of bugs.\nOne of the ways to mitigate this is testing: in essence, writing extra code,\noften with the aid of specialised tools, to validate the functionality of the\nactual program.\nThis will be a subject in future lessons and there are several other good\nreasons to implement testing in software, but for now do some research on the\ntopic. Here are some starting links:\n\nyoutube start at \n6 minute mark. A high-level overview on testing in general\ncodeproject.com\nLook up 'TDD' (Test Driven Development) and try to get a basic understanding \nof what it entails.\n\n"},"js-core/week-06/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core/week-06/lesson.html","title":"Week 6 - Debugging and more Data Structures","keywords":"","body":"\nJavaScript Core 7\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nDebugging\nObjects vs Arrays\nValue vs Reference Types\nScope\n\n\nDebugging\n\nExercise: Group exerciseGoing around the room what will the next log be\n\nfor (var i = 10; i  50) {\n    console.log(\"That's big\");\n  } else if (i > 100) {\n    console.log(\"Winner winner chicken dinner\");\n  } else {\n    console.log(i);\n  }\n}\n\n\nExercise: Now try it yourselfOn your own computers or paper write down the output of the below code section.After 10 minutes going around the room give the next output\n\ne.g.i=1 log 1i=2 log 2i=3 log Fizz\nfor (var i = 1; i \n\nDemonstration: Chrome dev toolsOpen the devToolsExample.html file in this weeks folder in chrome.

So when do you use an\nArray and when do you use an Object.\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.\" Linus Torvalds\nLet's talk about the differences between Arrays and Objects - when can you use or the other. As a general rule of thumb:\n\nDoes the order of data matter? Then use Arrays.\nCan the data be organised by a label? Then use Objects.\n\n\nExercise: Let's say we're writing a program to model and display a Newspaper:\nwhat data structure would you use to model the different sections of the\nnewspaper (sports, politics etc..)? Write a data structure in JavaScript to\nrepresent your newspaper\nExercise: Now if we're going to model a Book with different chapters - what\ndata strucuture would we use?\nExercise: Think of a scenario where we might need to combine both?\n\nObject Exercises\n\nExercise Write a function \"printProperties\" that takes an object and prints\nits properties\n\nvar student = {\n  name: \"Simon\",\n  age: \"21\",\n  interests: [\"javascript\", \"react\"]\n};\n\nprintProperties(student);\n// Output in this case should be name, age, interests\n\n\nExercise Write a function called hasProperty that takes an object and a\nproperty.

Tip: have a think about if you could re-use a function from a\nprevious example...\n\nValue vs Reference Types\nA variable can hold two types of values: primitives (value types) and reference\ntypes. The distinction between them is very important and will be a fundamental\naddition to your JavaScript arsenal.\nPrimitives are:\n\nstring (example: John Doe)\nnumber (example: 100)\nboolean (example: true or false)\n\nReference types are:\n\nObjects (example: {greeting: \"hello\"})\nArrays (example: [1,2,3])\nFunctions (example: function doNothing() { })\n\nVariables can only hold a few bytes of data. Because primitives have fixed\nsizes, when you assign a primitive to a variable, it will hold the actual value\nof the primitive (hence the name \"value type\"). But reference types can have\npractically infinite sizes, so when you assign a reference type to a variable,\nthat variable will hold a reference to it only: an identifier which will tell\nour program where to look for that object in memory.\n\nPass by value / reference\nConsider the example below.\nfunction addFive(value) {\n  value = value + 5;\n}\n\nvar ten = 10;\naddFive(ten);\nconsole.log(ten);\n\nWe have a function that accepts a value as an argument. The function then adds five to the\nargument and logs the value.\nAfter invoking the function with the variable ten, the variable is logged.\nWhat will be the values logged?\nAnswer: 10 (not 15)\nExplanation:\nIn JavaScript, variables are always passed to function by value. That means only the value\nthe variables was holding is passed to the function, and not a reference to the variable's\nlocation in memory. That means that inside a function call, any changes we make to its\narguments will only apply inside the function (as seen in the previous example).\nBe careful though, as the value of an argument might be a reference to a JavaScript\nobject, in which case, changing a property on that object will also reflect everywhere\nelse we use a reference to that object.\nFor example:\nfunction a(primitive, object) {\n  primitive = primitive + 5;\n  object.greeting = \"how are you?\";\n  object = {\n    greeting: \"holla!\"\n  };\n}\nvar primitive = 10;\nvar object = {\n  greeting: \"hello\"\n};\na(primitive, object);\nconsole.log(primitive); // 10\nconsole.log(object.greeting); // \"how are you?\"\n\n\nLet's look at the illustrations here\nto understand this behavior better\nExercise\n\nOpen up the\nCodePen here\nCreate a new index.html and main.js file\nLink the main.js from the index.html so that it runs in the browser\nCopy the exercises from the CodePen above into main.js and follow the\ninstructions in the comments\n\n\nScope\nBefore we get into what scope is, let's try a little exercise.\nOpen up jsbin and write the following:\nfunction () {\n    var name = \"hello\";\n}\nconsole.log(name);\n\n\nWhat do you think the first console.log will print?\n\nvar hello = \"outer\";\nfunction() {\n    var hello = \"inner\";\n    console.log(hello);\n}\n\n\nWhat do you think calling the function will print?\n\nLet's see another example\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  var a = 10;\n\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    console.log(a);\n  };\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis should work fine, and the console should print 10. But what if we swap\nthe positions of var a and the console.log()?\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  console.log(a);\n\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n  };\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nThis returns an error: ReferenceError: a is not defined. You might think that\nthe problem is that we're trying to console log a before it's declared in the\ncode order. So let's try putting the console.log(a) after secondFunction,\nwhere a is assigned:\nvar firstFunction = function() {\n  var secondFunction = function() {\n    var a = 10;\n  };\n\n  console.log(a);\n\n  secondFunction();\n};\n\nfirstFunction();\n\nWait, we're still getting the ReferenceError! Even if we move the\nconsole.log(a) underneath where secondFunction is called, we still get the\nerror. What's going on?\nWhat we're seeing here is the effect of scope. Take a look at the following\ndiagram:\n\nWe can see from this picture that each function is like a 'bubble', and it has\naccess to the variable assigned within it, and the variables assigned 'above'\nit, in it's surrounding function. But note that the 'global' scope doesn't have\naccess to var o, and function outer() doesn't have access to var i. So\neach function can access the variables in its parent scope, and in it's\nown, immediate scope, but it cannot see the variables in its child\nscope.\nIf a variable is declared outside of a function, in the 'window', it has\n'global' scope. The scope within a function is 'local' scope:\nvar test = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n  var test = \"I'm local\";\n  console.log(test);\n}\n\ntestScope(); // output: I'm local\n\nconsole.log(test); // output: I'm global\n\n\nExercise\n\nContinue working on your main.js from your previous exercises\nCopy the exercises from this\nCodePen\nRemember to comment/uncomment each set once you're done with them\n\n\nResources\n\nObjects vs Arrays\nJavaScript Arrays and Objects Are Just Like Books and Newspapers\n\nHomework\n\nCreate an account on CodeWars and do at least 15\nchallenges.\nSign up for the JavaScript 30 course and do at\nleast 2 project.

Every array has access to these methods (because Arrays are created by\nthe Array constructor function they inherit the the properties of\nArray.prototype).\nOf particular use are the Array methods that enable you to iterate over an\narray. We've covered iteration already when we learnt how to use for loops.\nWell, I have some amazing news for you - you will probably never need to write a\nfor loop again!\nLet's take a look at Array.prototype.forEach first. This is pretty much a\nstraight replacement for for loops.\nvar myArr = [1, 2, 3];\n\nmyArr.forEach(function(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n});\n\n// 1\n// 2\n// 3\n\nOOOOF! Wasn't that glorious?! Much nicer than writing a for loop! So how\nexactly does this work? forEach iterates over each item the array. For each\nitem is calls a function - the one that was provided as an parameter to\nforEach.\nCallback functions\nFunctions that are provided as parameters to another function are called\ncallback functions. Often we will write these functions inside the function\ncall like did in the forEach example, but we can also pass in reference to an\nalready defined function:\nfunction callback(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n}\n\nmyArr.forEach(callback);\n\nWhether you define your function beforehand or write it straight into the\nfunction call will depend on whether you intend on re-using that callback again.\n\nExercise\nLet's create a function called average that receives an array of numbers.\nImplement the function using a forEach method calculate the average of all\nnumbers passed in and return it.\n\nMore array methods\nPreviously we've used for loops to create new versions of an array doing\nsomething like this:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = [];\n\nfor (var i = 0; i \nThere are several methods on Array.prototype that can be used for this sort of\ntask.\nThe most popular method is .map(), which does the following:\n\niterates over the array it is called on\ncalls a callback function on every iteration\npasses in the current array item and its index to the callback function\nuses the returned value from the callback function to populate a new array\nreturns the new array\n\nThat sounds like a lot but once you use .map() a few times it'll begin to feel\nmore intuitive. Let's try it and see if we can refactor the for loop example:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar newArr = arr.map(function(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [2,3,4]\n\nAnother useful array method is .filter(). It works in a similar way to map\nexcept that rather than return a value in the callback function, you return\ntrue or false depending on whether you want the current item to be included\nin the new array. Returning true means that you want to keep the item,\nreturning false means it should be omitted.\nLet's create a new array with only numbers greater than 5:\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];\nvar newArr = arr.filter(function(num) {\n  return num > 5;\n});\nconsole.log(newArr); // [6,7,8,9]\n\n\nRemember: Most array methods do not change the current array, they return a\nnew array. Check the MDN documentation for the array method if you are not\nsure about this.\n\nChaining methods\nIf we want to apply more than one array method to an array we might try\nsomething like this, creating an intermediate variable after each\ntransformation.\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nvar arrMapped = arr.map(function(num) {\n  return num + 1;\n});\nvar arrFiltered = newArr.filter(function(num) {\n  return num > 5;\n});\n\nThis can get quite awkward though, especially when you have to think of a\nvariable name for each stage. Thankfully there is a much simpler way. We can\nchain methods together:\nvar newArr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n  .map(function (num) {\n    return num + 1;\n  })\n  .filter(function (num) {\n    return num > 5;\n  });\n  console.log(newArr); // [6,7]\n\nThere's nothing magical happening here. This works because:\n\nthe array methods are returning new arrays\nevery array has access to all the array methods on Array.prototype\n\nAs soon as an array is returned by an array method we can call another array\nmethod on the return value.\n\nExercise\nTransform the following array [4,5,3,6,7,8,9,1,2] by 1) sorting it, 2)\ndoubling each number, and 3) filtering numbers less than 10 Write named\nfunctions that can be used as callbacks.\n\nHomework\n\nSubmit a PR and pass all the functions for the\nunit-testing-london\nrepository\n\nLook at each other's Pull Requests and leave feedback\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead:\nDocument Object Model (DOM)\n\nRead:\nCallback function\n\n\n"},"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-2/week-08/lesson.html","title":"Week 8 - DOM, Events","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Core: in the Browser\n\n What we will learn today?\n\nDOM\nEvents\n\n\nThe DOM\nYour webpages are made up of a bunch of HTML elements, nested within each other\n(parents and children). In JavaScript we have access to this \"DOM\" object\n(Document Object Model) which is actually a representation of our webpage that\nJavaScript can work with.\nIn the browser the DOM is represented by the window.document object, which can\nalso be accessed directly using document. We can use it to get information\nabout the page loaded into the browser, query the content of the page and edit\nit. You can see full details of the functionality\nhere.\nQuerying\nThe DOM offers a lot of useful functions we can use to find elements on the\npage. Here are some we'll be using today:\n// gets an Element with id 'submit'\nvar element = document.getElementById(\"submit\");\n\ngetElementById accepts an id string as argument and returns an Element from\nthe document with a matching id. If no matching Element is found the function\nreturns null.\n// get an HTMLCollection containing elements with class 'link'\nvar links = document.getElementsByClassName(\"link\");\n\ngetElementsByClassName takes a string containing one or more classes and\nreturns an HTMLCollection, which is an array-like object containing all\nelements whose class attributes match the string. We can pass multiple classes\nas an argument to query for elements matching all classes.\n// get an Element with id 'submit'\nvar form = document.getElementById(\"myform\");\n// get an HTMLCollection containing elements with class 'red'\n// which are children of the 'form' element\nvar inputs = form.getElementsByClassName(\"red\");\n\ngetElementsByClassName can be called on individual elements as well as the\ntop-level document object. When calling getElementsByClassName on an\nelement, the method will query only the children of the element rather than\nthe entire document\nvar elements = document.getElementsByTagName(\"div\"); // or:\nvar elements = someElement.getElementsByTagName(\"a\");\n\nMuch like getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName allows us to query\nfor elements using the tag name. getElementsByTagName also returns\nHTMLCollection and can be called on elements as well as document.\nAll of the above calls return a live reference, which means that the objects\nwill be automatically updated with all changes since the query.\n\nExercise:\n\n Clone the repo from HTML and CSS class into new bikes directory. git\nclone git@github.com:dmitrigrabov/bikes-for-refugees.git bikes\n Once cloned run npm install to download the dependencies:\n Implement getTitle, getNumberOfBikes, getAllButtonText,\ngetNavLinksText in src/functions.js using above methods to get all tests\npassing using npm test:\n\n\nQuery selector\nThe above selector functions are available in all browsers, but can be somewhat\ninflexible for example in situations that require complex lookups. Modern\nbrowsers have\ndocument.querySelector(\"#mainHeader\");\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"p\");\n\nBoth .querySelector and querySelectorAll accept a CSS selector as an input.\n.querySelector selects only the first element it finds, querySelectorAll\nselects all elements and returns a NodeList, which is a collection of Nodes\n(not an array). Unlike the selectors in the previous section, these functions\nreturn static results. That means any changes in the DOM will NOT result in\nupdates to the elements.\n\nExercise:\n\n Rewrite solutions to previous exercise using querySelector and\nquerySelectorAll. You may need to look up documentation for NodeList.\n\n\nDOM manipulation\nWe can use the DOM to edit elements. For example the textContent property of\nelements can used to read as well as set the text contents of an element.\nvar x = document.querySelector(\".jumbotron h1\");\nconsole.log(x.textContent); // Bikes for Refugees\nx.textContent = \"Something else\";\n\nSimilarly, innerHTML property of elements can be used to get the HTML content\nof an element as well as\nvar x = document.querySelector(\".jumbotron h1\");\nx.innerHTML = \"\" + x.textContent + \"\";\n\nWe can also access the style property of elements and update various\nproperties\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll(\".btn-primary\");\n\nelements.forEach(function(element) {\n  element.style.backgroundColor = \"red\";\n});\n\nPlease note the use of camelCase style attribute names\nWe can also check it exists, read, change and remove attributes of elements\nusing hasAttribute, getAttribute(), removeAttribute and setAttribute\nvar elements = document.querySelectorAll(\"a\");\n\nelements.forEach(element => {\n  if (element.hasAttribute(\"href\")) {\n    var href = element.getAttribute(\"href\");\n    element.setAttribute(\"href\", \"https://google.com\");\n  }\n});\n\nWhat will above code do?\n\nExercise:\nUse above functions to\n\n place - around the text in the navbar links\n convert links in 'Upcoming Events' section to italic using  tag\n make Learn more links green\n Ensure all tests for above pass\n\n\nCreating and inserting elements\nWe can use document.createElement(tagName) method to create a new element and\ndocument.createTextNode(text) to create new text contents. The elements\ncreated can be manipulated just like the elements above, but the changes will\nnot be visible until we insert the new element into the DOM.\nWe can insert elements into other elements using element.appendChild or\nelement.insertBefore. For example.\n\n  some content\n\n\nvar spanNode = document.createElement(\"span\");\nvar textNode = document.createTextNode(\"hello\");\nspanNode.appendChild(textNode);\n\nvar parentNode = document.getElementById(\"parent\");\nparentNode.appendChild(spanNode);\n\nWhat do you think above code will do?\ninsertBefore is a bit more complicated.\nvar insertedNode = parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode);\n\nHere insertedNode is the the node being inserted, that is newNode.\nparentNode is the the parent of the newly inserted node. newNode is the node\nto be inserted and referenceNode is the node before which newNode is inserted.\n\nExercise:\n\n Use the inspector to examine the navbar\n Using createElement etc. create a new navbar item link 'Code Your Future'\nwhich links to https://codeyourfuture.io/. It should have same structure\nas the other links\n Insert it at the end of the navbar\n Ensure all tests for above pass\n\n\nResources\n\nDOM: Document\nMDN: DOM Examples and explanation\n\nBrowser events\nBrowser events are actions that take place on our web page. They could be user\ntriggered such as a mouse being clicked, a key being pressed or a form\nsubmitted. Alternatively, they could be triggered by the system such as a\nresource being loaded or an error occurring.\nWe can subscribe to those events by registering an eventHandler to perform a\ncertain action when an event is detected. For example, we may want to update a\nletter count on a text input when a user types or we may want to perform\nvalidation on a form before submitting it.\nFor each event subscription we will need 3 things:\n\ntarget - this is the object where we are listening for events on. For\nexample, it could be a link on which we would like to listen to for clicks.\neventType - as the name suggests, this is the type of event we ar listening\nfor. There are dozens of possible events (see\nhere for the full\nlist). Common ones include . click - mouse click . submit - form submit .\nkeydown - keyboard key being pressed . mouseenter - a mouse cursor being\nmoved onto an element . change - value of a form input changing\neventHandler - A function that we want to execute when the event is\ndetected\n\nTo subscribe to the actual event we use the addEventListener method of our\ntarget element like below\nvar myButton = document.querySelector(\"#myButton\");\nmyButton.addEventListener(\"click\", alertSomething);\n\nfunction alertSomething() {\n  alert(\"Something\");\n}\n\nIn the above code myButton is the target on which we listen to for click\nevents and call the event handler alertSomething when the click is detected.\n\nExercise:\n\n Set a click listener on the donate buttons and increment the donated bikes\ncounter with each click ( no tests )\n\n\nEvent object\nJust knowing that an event has happened is not particularly useful in most\ncases. Usually, we will want to know more about what exactly happened such as\nthe coordinates of a mouse click or the new value of an input after it has\nchanged.\nKeep in mind that different event types will have characteristics that are\nspecific to them. For example, key events will have a event.char property\nindicating the key that was pressed. mouse events will have event.clientX\nand event.clientY properties indicating the location of the mouse event on the\nscreen, where (0,0) is the top left hand corner in the browser.\nEvery event object has a .preventDefault() which when called will prevent\nthe default action of the event from being triggered. This is particularly\nuseful to intercepting events and altering the behaviour when needed. For\nexample, we can call event.preventDefault() on a submit event if the data in\nthe form is not valid.\nWe can find out which element the event was triggered on from the event.target\nproperty.\n\nExercise:\n\n Prevent clicks on links from triggering a url change in the browser and\ninstead console.log the coordinates of the click as well as the text\ninside the link\n\n\nBubbling\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's place a click listener on the .jumbotron element and console.log\nthe event\nWhat happens when we click on the buttons?\n\n\nMost events, though not all, have a default behaviour know as bubbling which\nresults in events being propagated to the target element's parents. That means\nan event listener placed on the parent will be triggered after the event\nlistener placed on the child. Why is this behaviour desired?\nWe can distinguish between the elements on which the event was triggered vs the\nelement on which the event was detected.\n\nevent.target is the element on which received the initial event\nevent.currentTarget is the element on which the event listener detected the\nevent\n\nIn some cases we may want to prevent an event from bubbling up. We can do so by\ncalling the stopPropagation method on the event. Once it has been called, any\nevent handlers placed by parent elements will not be triggered.\n\nTogether:\n\nLet's prevent clicks on 'Volunteer' button from bubbling up to above\nlistener using stopPropagation\n\n\nResources\n\nIntroduction to browser events\nEvents\n\nHomework\n\nFork\nbookshelf-project.\nOpen up readme.md and follow the instructions in there.

For these type of functions, the callback is called once another function has completed. This allows you to run some other code while you're waiting for something to finish.\nfunction finished() {\n  console.log(\"The task has finished\");\n}\n\nfunction thingThatTakesALongTime(callback) {\n  //... Task that takes a long time to complete\n\n  callback(); // This is where the 'console.log' happens\n}\n\n// Pass the function to 'thingThatTakesALongTime' just like a normal variable\nthingThatTakesALongTime(finished);\n\nSo far all of the callbacks you have been using have been synchronous. This means your code is executed one line at a time, at the same time, in order. Asynchronous code is not executed in order, and can run at any time, in any order.\nAn example of this in real life, are phone calls and text messages.\n\nPhone calls are synchronous because you can't (really) do anything while the\nother person is speaking. You are always waiting for your turn to respond\nText messages are asynchronous. When you send a text, you can go away and do\nsomething else, until the other person responds.\n\nA simple example of an asynchronous function is setTimeout. This allows you to run a function after a\ngiven time period. The first argument is the function you want to run, the\nsecond argument is the delay (in milliseconds)\n// Separate function definition\nfunction myCallbackFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Hello world!\");\n}\nsetTimeout(myCallbackFunction, 1000);\n\n// Inline function\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  console.log(\"Goodbye world!\");\n}, 500);\n\n\nExercises\n\nUsing setTimeout, change the background color of the page after 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds).\nUpdate your code to make the color change every 5 seconds to something different. Hint: try searching for setInterval.\n\n\n\nPromises\nPromises are a new(ish) feature of JavaScript. They allow for\nwriting easier to understand code when dealing with asynchronous functions.\n\nPromises are more \"abstract\" than anything we have covered so far. They are a data structure that represents some result that is going to happen in the future. The result starts off as being unknown (pending) as the code has not completed yet. The result can then move to be successful (fulfilled) or failed (rejected).\nThe API is very simple. When you have a Promise, you can attach a .then\nmethod with a callback and/or a .catch method with a callback. If the promise is successful, then the function\nin the .then callback is called. If it fails, then the .catch callback is\ncalled.\n// Call a function that returns a Promise\nvar myPromise = functionThatReturnsAPromise();\n\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"success: \" + value);\n});\n\nmyPromise.catch(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"fail:\" + value);\n});\n\nThe .then and .catch methods can be chained, like with Array methods:\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"success: \" + value);\n})\n.catch(function(value) {\n  console.log(\"fail: \" + value);\n})\n\nYou can even return a Promise from within a .then callback, and keep chaining on more .then callbacks. This allows you to process part of the value and keep passing it along the chain:\n// myPromise resolves with a value of 50\nmyPromise.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(value) // Logs: 50\n  return Promise.resolve(value + 50); // Returns a new Promise\n})\n.then(function(value) {\n  console.log(value) // Logs: 100\n})\n\nWe will look at some common functions that return a Promise in a bit, but you can also create your own Promise. This example shows a Promise being \"resolved\" (successful):\nvar myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // Do some work in this function\n  resolve(100); // Resolves the Promise with the value 100\n});\n\nThis example shows a Promise being \"rejected\" (failed):\nvar myPromise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  // Do some work in this function\n  reject(50) // Rejects the Promise with the value 50\n});\n\n\nExercises\nComplete the exercises in this CodePen\n\nAJAX\nWhat's a server?\nA device or program that provides functionality to other programs or\ndevices. There are database servers, mail servers, game servers, etc. The vast majority of these servers are accessed over the internet.\nThey can take the form of industrial server farms that provide a service to\nmillions of users (used by Facebook, Google, etc.), to personal servers for\nstoring your files.\nThe server communicates with clients. Clients can be a web browser, a Slack\napp, your phone, etc.\nClient–server systems use the request–response model: a client sends a\nrequest to the server, which performs some action and sends a response back to\nthe client, typically with a result or acknowledgement.\n\nAn example: We can use the Slack app (the client) to put our messages or\npictures on Slack. The content is stored on the Slack servers and other\nclients can then also access the pictures.\n\nHTTP requests\nA server stores the data, and the client (other programs or computers) requests\ndata or sends some of its own. But how do they talk to each other?\nFor the client and the server to communicate they need an established language\n(a protocol). Which is what HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is for. It\ndefines the methods you can use to communicate with a server and indicate your\ndesired actions on the resources of the server.\nThere are two main types of requests: GET and POST.\n\nWith a GET request you can ask for specified resource (e.g. show me that\nSlack photo).\nWith a POST request you can send content to the server to be appended to\nthe web resource (e.g. post a photo on Slack).\n\nHTTP is the language of the internet. In our case we're using JavaScript, but\nyou can send HTTP requests with other languages as well.\nAJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)\nAJAX is a technique for implementing client-server communication in the browser. The word is a bit of a misnomer as generally we don't use XML any more, but it's still commonly used to describe this technique.\n\nAjax just uses a combination of:\n\n\nA browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)\nJavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)\n\n\nAjax works behind the scenes, helping the webpage communicate with the server\n(with GET and POST requests).\n\nclient --> GET request --> server returns data to client\nclient --> POST request (with body content) --> server updates data with body content\n\nTypically, the server holds the data, and only sends it to the client (web page) when there's a\nrequest. Ajax requests are sent after the page has loaded, usually in response to an action by the user. For example when the user clicks a button, some JavaScript will trigger an Ajax request to fetch data.\nWhy Ajax?\nThere are other ways you can write HTTP requests, such as using Web sockets.\nWhat's great about Ajax is that it makes it look like magic! The server and the\nclient communicate effortlessly:\n\nUpdate a web page without reloading the page Request data from a server -\nafter the page has loaded Receive data from a server - after the page has\nloaded Send data to a server - in the background\n\nFetch\nfetch is a way of creating HTTP requests in JavaScript. It uses of the Promise API.\nThis example shows a GET request that fetches some data and logs it out:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665')\n  .then(function(response) {\n    // Necessary line to parse the JSON (we'll cover this \n    // in more detail in upcoming weeks)\n    // Returns another Promise\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function(json) {\n    // Do something with the json response object\n    console.log(json.data); // Logs: 'Hello world!'\n  });\n\nTo create a POST request, you can pass an options object as the second argument to fetch with the method property set to 'POST'. Any data that you want to send should be set as the body property.\nHere is an example showing a POST request:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: 'I am sending a POST request!'\n})\n  .then(function(response) { return response.json() })\n  .then(function(json) {\n    console.log(json.data)\n  })\n\nTypically it is more useful to servers if they receive structured data like JSON. We will cover JSON more in upcoming weeks, but for now it is sufficient to know that it is a way of structuring data to send over the internet.\nTo send a POST request with JSON you need to add a little more information to the request - a headers property must be included which marks the request as contains JSON. This will give the server a hint that it needs to parse JSON in the request.\nHere is an example showing a POST request with JSON:\nfetch('http://www.mocky.io/v2/5a22e20a2f0000c00d5ec665', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    // Mark the request as containing JSON\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({ // Converts objects to JSON\n    data: 'I am sending a POST request with JSON'\n  })\n})\n\n\nExercise\nEveryone should organise in pairs to write a very simple chat application. One person will write the code to send data (with a POST request) to a server and one to fetch it (with a GET request).\n\nStart with this CodePen project\nCreate a function that makes a POST request that sends a new chat message to the server\nCreate a function that makes a GET request that fetches all messages from the server\nWire up the #fetch-messages button so that it makes the GET request then inserts the chat messages into the #message-list element\nWire up the #create-message button so that it makes the POST request\nThe URL to send requests to is https://luxuriant-scorpion.glitch.me/chat (for both GET and POST). Note that it is a JSON API, so you'll need the response.json() method to parse responses and the Content-Type header for POST requests.\n\n\nResources\n\nUnderstand JavaScript Callback Functions and Use Them\nJavaScript Callbacks Explained Using Minions\nMDN Promise docs\npromisejs.org\nGoogle Developer article on Promises\nMDN AJAX docs\nMDN fetch API\nDavid Walsh blog post\n\nHomework\n\nPlease Make sure you have finished the bookshelf project, including the\nstretch goals\nWork in pairs to do Weather App Exercise and send the link to your\nrepository on your trello card.\n\nWeather App\nWorking in pairs, build a web app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a\nlocation of your choice.

It allows for us to more\neasily modify and extend code. It saves space and improves performance.\nAt the most basic level, a function is a series of instructions that can take an\ninput and produce an output. Parameters dictate how the function behaves.\n\nWe've used functions a bit, but now we need to know how to use them well.\nThere are many ways to write code that does the same thing. But are they all\nequal?\n\nExercise: Let's look at a really obvious example of a function with redundant\ncode. What could we do to improve it?\n\nfunction printHelloFiveTimes() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\n\n\nExercise: write an improved version of this function\n\nNow, let's look at a different example. Let's say we wanted to welcome mentors:\nfunction welcomeMentors() {\n  console.log(\"Hello Mozafar\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Rares\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Tim\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Ashleigh\");\n  console.log(\"Hello Gordon\");\n}\n\nWe could be lazy and change how we welcome the mentors.\nfunction welcomeMentors() {\n  var mentorNames = \"Mozafar, Rares, Tim, Ashleigh, Gordon\";\n  console.log(\"Hello \" + mentorNames);\n}\n\nBut it's not quite the output we wanted. And we can be smarter about it. Why not\na loop?\n\nExercise: write an improved version of this function\n\nSo functions help us to organise and enhance our code. But what makes good\ndesign? Is it just \"shorter is always better\"?\nGood Design\nDesign is important if we want our code to be understandable (both to other\nhumans, but also to us in the future), to be easy to use and easy to expand.\nThere are three main principles you need to know now: clarity, reusability and\nextensibility. There are also others, but they are deeply related to these\nthree.\n\nEase of Maintenance / Clarity\n\nNaming\nCommenting\nClear logic\nConcise\nFormatting\nAvoiding Redundancy\n\n\nReusability\n\nDRY\nSingle Reponsibility\nAvoiding global state (scope)\nPredictability and Ease of testing\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility\n\nAvoiding being unnecessarily specific (e.g. magic numbers)\n\n\n\nNow let's take a look at a bigger example of a badly written function\nfunction myFunction(salary, taxCode, incomeTax1, incomeTax2, ownsCar) {\n  var totalIncomeTax = incomeTax1 + incomeTax2;\n  var studentLoan = (salary - 17775) * 0.09;\n  var originalSalary = salary;\n  var nationalInsurance = null;\n\n  if (taxCode === \"1150L\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.1;\n  } else if (taxCode === \"ST\") {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.05;\n  } else {\n    nationalInsurance = salary * 0.08;\n  }\n\n  var deductions = [nationalInsurance, totalIncomeTax, studentLoan];\n\n  salary = salary - deductions[0];\n  salary = salary - deductions[1];\n  salary = salary - deductions[2];\n\n  return (\n    \"Your gross income is £\" +\n    originalSalary.toString() +\n    \" and your net income is £\" +\n    salary.toString() +\n    \".\"\n  );\n}\n\nconsole.log(myFunction(28000, \"1150L\", 1000, 580, false));\n\nWhat is wrong with this function?\n\nNaming: the function has a bad name, myFunction() tells you nothing about\nwhat the function does. It's also considered bad practice to name variables\nvaguely by separating them through numbers (incomeTax1, incomeTax2, etc). If\nyou find yourself doing this then you should either use an array (such as\nincomeTax[]).\n\nCommenting: the function isn't documented at all. It's very difficult to\nunderstand what the function's purpose is and how each part of the code\ncontributes to it. By writing comments, the coder communicates their\nreasoning and helps the function be human readable.\n\nLayout/formatting: unnecessary spacing between the if and else statement.\n\nSingle responsibility: the function doesn't have a single purpose. It\ncalculates national insurance and salary deductions. Maybe the national\ninsurance calculation could be moved to a separate function.\n\nInput variable being overwritten: the function requires gross salary (before\ndeductions) and net salary (after deductions) the salary input variable is\ntherefore copied into an originalSalary variable so that it can be changed.\nIt would be much clearer to create a new netSalary variable and leave\nsalary unmodified.\n\nDRY principle: the function validates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule.\nThe line where a deduction is taken from the salary is repeated 3 times with\ndifferent indices. This can be replaced with a for loop.\n\nMagic numbers. The code contains a lot of magic numbers, including 17775,\n0.09 and 0.1.\n\nUseless parameters: the code contains a variable which isn't used. They\nshould be removed because they are confusing. It is tempting when you're\nstarting to code a function to add more parameters thinking that you might\nneed them, but it's important to remove them if you don't end up using them.\n\n\n\nExercise: Working in pairs, go through all of these issues and make\nappropriate improvements to the code.\nExercise: Write a function that will print out the number of vowels that are\nin mentors' names.\n\nTDD\nBefore we get started\n\nFork >\nthis repository to\nyour own Github account, then clone it to your computer.\\\nToday's exercises will be based on this repository.\n\nUnit Testing\nTesting is a key skill for any software programmer. We need to make sure our\nsoftware is thoroughly tested, otherwise bad things happen. Testing makes sure\nour programs behave like we intend them to do - if we don't test, we can cause\nsevere bugs. Bad software can make planes crash, companies bankrupt, and users\nof your software really frustrated.\nThere are different levels on which we can test software, for example\nintegration testing, end-to-end testing, and unit testing. Today we will deal\nwith unit testing, which is probably the most universal testing discipline.\nA unit test is exactly that - it tests a unit of code. \"Unit\" can mean\ndifferent things, but in JavaScript it usually refers to a single function.\nRemember when we talked about functions? Functions take input (as arguments),\ndo something with it (in the function body), and return output (using the\nreturn statement). Ideally, a function should always return the same output if\nthe same input is given. It makes it predictable and testable - and that's what\nwe want!\n         |-----------------|\ninput => | doing something | => output\n         |-----------------|\nSo, when unit testing a function, we want to make sure that for a certain\ninput, we get the expected output. For this we need to make sure that the\noutput matches our expectations. In the simplest form that means we do an\nequality check:\nmyFunction(input) === expectedOutput;\n\nWe can formalise this using another function that compares two values and\ncomplains when they do not match. Such a function is prepared in\nunit-testing/equals.js.\nWe can use this function to simply compare to values:\nequals(1, 1); // This should pass\nequals(1, 2); // This should fail\nequals(\"Hello\", \"Hello\"); // This should pass\n\nNow we can use this equals() function to test our own code by comparing a\nfunction result to an expected value.\nRemember that one function can be used as an argument when a second function is called. In this instance, the function we are testing would represent our first function, and our equals() function would represent the second, like so...\nequals(myNewFunction(arg1, arg2, etc), expectedOutput)\n\nAs you can see in this example, instead of using a number as the first argument to the equals() function, we have used a function instead; the one we wish to test.\n\nTogether: Follow the instructions in unit-testing/sum.js!\nExercise: Now you! Take the provided unit-testing/findNeedle.js and turn\nit into a function that returns a result instead of printing it. Then run it\nusing multiple inputs and make sure it returns the correct results each time!\n\nTest-driven development (TDD)\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on\nthe repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into\nvery specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests,\nonly. (Wikipedia)\n\nA key principle in TDD is that we write think about our requirements before we\ndive into code: What should our program be able to do? What are our edge cases?\nWe formalise those requirements by writing tests - even before our program is\nwritten! At this time, all our tests will fail, because we haven't written any\ncode yet. Our tests are now RED (the colour represents a failing test).\nNow we want to turn this RED into GREEN. We do this by implementing our\nfunction in a way that covers all our test cases.\n\nExercise: Follow the instructions in tdd/findNeedle.js!\n\nRefactoring\nThere are times when we want to make our code better without changing any\nfunctionality, for example because we just learnt about a better way to solve a\ncertain problem (like, finding needles in haystacks). This is called\nrefactoring.\nWhen previously GREEN code - working code! - suddenly does not work anymore,\nwe call this a regression. Our existing tests can make sure that when we\nrefactor, the functionality of our code actually stays the same, and does not\nregress.\n\nTogether: Refactor the findNeedle function we just wrote to be implemented\nusing .map() and .filter().\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nThere are lots of other things you might want to test for than two things being\nequal. You might want to test if a number is smaller or greater than another, if\na function was called, if an error happened, or if one thing happened before\nanother thing, or how long a function call took to execute.\nWe don't have to build all these things ourselves. Instead there are unit\ntesting frameworks that take all that work off our shoulders. All we need to do\nis provide the code and the tests.\nJest\nThe unit testing framework we are trying to day is called\nJest. It's created by Facebook and useful\nfor all kinds of unit testing (especially testing React, which we will do in a\nlater lesson).\nLook into your jest/ folder. You will find a file there, sum.test.js. The\nsuffix .test.js tells Jest that this file contains tests it should execute. To\nexecute the test, run the following command in your terminal:\nnpm test\n\nThis command runs the test in sum.test.js, which tests the sum() function.\nYou can see the test output and the fact that the test passed.\nTests cases in Jest have the following structure:\ntest(\"test description\", function() {\n  // Test instructions\n});\n\nJest provides a set of functions that you can use to write your actual tests.\nThey are created in a way that imitates natural language, for example:\n_Expect_ sum of 1 and 2 _to be_ 3\nbecomes\nexpect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);\n\nYou can add multiple test statements in the same test case (a test case is one\ncall of the test function, but you can also create multiple test cases in one\nfile. It is important that you give all your test cases meaningful descriptions.\n\nExercise: Add another test case to sum.test.js. Is the sum of 10 and -10\nreally zero? Run the tests using Jest.\nExercise: Take the findNeedle function you have tested previously, copy it\ninto the jest/ folder and call it findNeedle.test.js. Then write a test to\nbe used with Jest, similar to sum.test.js. Make sure you cover multiple\ninputs and give all tests meaningful descriptions! Run the tests using Jest.\n\nTest coverage\nTest coverage describes the extent to which a code base is tested. When Jest\nruns your tests, it generates a so-called coverage report. This report tells\nyou how many of your lines of code are covered by tests, how many functions,\nstatements, and branches.\n\nA branch is one of multiple ways a code control flow can go. For example, if\nyou have an if() ... else ..., both the \"if\" and the \"else\" branch must be\ncovered by tests.\n\nWe want to keep our code coverage as high as possible. Jest allows us to\ngenerate a coverage report when we run the following command in the terminal:\nnpm test -- --coverage\n\n\nExercise: Check your code coverage for the tests you wrote. Is any of the\nnumbers below 100%? If so, try and bring it up to 100%!\n\nResources\n\nJavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford, chapter 4 - Functions\nMDN Objects basics\nMDN OOP in JS\nTest-driven development\nJest\nModules\n\nHomework\n\nFind examples in your own code where you violated the three principles of\ngood code (Clarity, Reusability, Extensibility).

Let's see how it\nworks.\nExercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks\nif gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make\nthe code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.\n\nClasses and Context\nA class is an important concept in object-oriented programming. In general, a\nclass can be described as a \"blueprint\" or a \"plan\" for creating objects. After\na class is created, new objects with all of the features defined in that class\ncan then be created. These objects are called instances of the class.\nSecondly, It's hard to talk about objects without talking about context and the\nthis keyword. When we execute a function in javascript, that function is\nassociated with some enclosing object. That object could be one that we made\nourselves, or it could be the global scope (the Window object). Understanding\ncontext allows us to understand when and where we can manipulate an object's\nproperties.\nA warning about javascript \"classes\"\nSpeaking strictly, javascript does not have proper classes. However ES6 provides\nfunctionality that allows us to create things that usually look and act like\nproper classes. At this point in your learning, this difference might not seem\nimportant but it will be useful to remember when you are doing more complex work\nin the future. Part of the homework after this class is to read about these\ndifferences.\nCreating a class\nI own a library and want to keep track of the books that people are borrowing\nand returning. Using the style that we previously learned, we could implement a\nsystem like this:\nlet myBooks = [\n  \"Wild Swans\",\n  \"The Dharma Bums\",\n  \"Nausea\",\n  \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\"\n];\nlet library = {\n  books: myBooks,\n  availableBooks: myBooks,\n  checkoutBook: function(book) {\n    this.availableBooks = this.availableBooks.filter(b => b !== book);\n  }\n};\n\nNow our book system has become popular in the library world, and we need to\nrepresent a lot of different libraries, each one requiring a copy of the object\nformat we specified above. We might even need to extend our library object to\nsuit specific cases. We can prepare for this scenario by creating a class called\nLibrary, provided a plan for our library objects.\nclass Library {\n  constructor(books) {\n    this.books = books;\n    this.availableBooks = books;\n  }\n\n  checkoutBook(book) {\n    this.availableBooks = this.availableBooks.filter(b => b !== book);\n  }\n}\n\nlet myBooks = [\n  \"Wild Swans\",\n  \"The Dharma Bums\",\n  \"Nausea\",\n  \"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\"\n];\nlet myLibrary = new Library(myBooks);\n\n\nExercise: Add a returnBook function which appends a book onto the\navailableBooks variable in our myLibrary object.\nExercise: check out \"Nausea\" and return it to the library.\nExercise: Alter the checkoutBook function to return false when a book\nisn't available, and true otherwise.\n\nUsing Inheritance to extend our library\nWe want to store information about a new library which contains audiobooks as\nwell as ordinary books. Audiobooks cannot be checked out, so they only need to\nbe stored. This new library should have all the same functionality regarding\nordinary books as our old Library object, but the class should be extended to\nallow for the storage of an audiobooks array.\nMore on this\n\nExercise: what does this refer to in the following code snippets?\n\nfunction getThis() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    return this;\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    let myObject = {\n      thisFunction: function() {\n        return this;\n      }\n    };\n    return myObject.thisFunction();\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nclass MyClass {\n  getThis() {\n    let myObject = { thisFunction: () => this };\n    return myObject.thisFunction();\n  }\n}\n\nlet myClass = new MyClass();\nconsole.log(myClass.getThis());\n\nMore ES6\nThere are so many features in ES6. They're mostly what we call syntax sugar.\nThey don't provide new functionality, but new (more elegant) ways of\naccomplishing the same tasks.\nSince not all ES6 features are supported in all browsers, many developers and\nprojects use what is called Transpilation - a process that\ntranspiles/translates ES6 code to ES5 syntax that is supported by all browsers.\nOn Node, most ES6 features are now natively supported in Node 8.\n\nFrom now on, we expect you to use ES6 syntax in your assignments and the code\nyou write.\n\nTDD again\n\nExercise: Clone the repo https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises\nLet's talk about TDD again?\n\nWhy do we do TDD\nHow do we run the tests? Read some of the tests\nNotice we're separating our tests from our code now. We are making use of\nmodules\nAlso notice the coverage\n\n\nHow do modules work?\nSo far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs\ncan become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be\nmaintainable.\nWe can therefore split our code into so-called modules. A module is basically\na JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and\nprograms.\nCreating modules, exporting code\nIt is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module\nby exporting its functionality:\nfunction printName(name) {\n  console.log(\"My name is \" + name);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = printName;\n\nThe key here is the line containing module.exports. As you see, this is an\nassignment, and whatever is assigned to module.exports will be made available\nto other modules and program when this file is imported.\nUsing modules, importing code\nBut how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to import it,\nand this is done using a function called require().\n\nThere are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here,\nwhich is natively supported by Node, is called CommonJS.\n\nvar printName = require(\"./printName.js\");\n\n\nThe string passed to the require() function is a path to the file you are\nimporting. ./ signifies the current directory, so the above command will\nimport a file called \"printName.js\" that is in the same directory as our\nprogram.\n\nAssuming our program is in the same folder as printName.js, we can use the\nabove code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in\nthe printName variable.\nWe can then continue to use the printName function as if it we defined it in\nour own program!\nvar printName = require('./printName.js');\n\nprintName();\n\nModules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already\nlearned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing\nmultiple functions.\nTogether: Edit the file modules/main.js and follow the instructions.\n\nSeparating code and tests\nExporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.\nAs a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is\ntherefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file\ncontaining the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just\nappending .test at the end of the filename. Like so:\nmain.js               # Our main program\nmain.test.js          # Tests for our main program\nsomeOtherCode.js      # A module called \"someOtherCode\"\nsomeOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the \"someOtherCode\" module\n\nThe naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a\ndifferent folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files\n\"*.test.js\".\n\nResources\n\nES6 features\nLet and const\n\nHomework\n\nDo part 2 of cyf-election.\n\nClone this repo and do the exercises involving converting ES5 code to ES6.\n\nRead and understand examples #1 to #4 in this blog post about context and this.\n\n\n"},"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html":{"url":"js-core-3/week-12/lesson.html","title":"Week 12 - Recap","keywords":"","body":"\nTo Be Agreed\nJS Core III\n What we will learn today?\n\nTopic 1\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nTopic 4\n\n\nTopic 1\nHigh level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises\n\nExercise: Always have exercises\n\nTopic 2\nTopic 3\nResources\n\nResource 1 to learn more about Topic 1\nResource 2 for Topic 2\n\nHomework\n\nFirst part of Homework - Easy\n\nSecond part of Homework - Intermediate/Hard\n\n[Bonus/Optional] Third part/optional - Hardest\n\n\nPrepare for the next class\n\nRead this Some Tutorial or Video etc...\n\n"},"node-db/":{"url":"node-db/","title":"Node/DB I","keywords":"","body":"Node\n\n\n\nWeek\nContent\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n\nweek-13\nNode, Express workshop\nExpress Workshop 1\n\n\nweek-14\nTemplating\nExpress Workshop 2\n\n\nweek-15\nNode Best Practices\nHotel workshop\n\n\n\n"},"node-db/week-13/lesson.html":{"url":"node-db/week-13/lesson.html","title":"Week 13 - Node and Express 101","keywords":"","body":"\nNode 1\nWhat we will learn today?\n\nWhat is a server?\nNode and its ecosystem\nHTTP\nExpress\nWorkshop\n\n\nWhat is a server?\nServers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the\nclients and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and\nsoftware resources.\n...and what is a server in plain English?\nA server is a computer program. Its job is to send and receive data.\nLet's take a website for example. A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS\nfiles, images, maybe some javascript files.

For example, let's imagine that you wanted to log every request\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\nconst myLogger = (req, res, next) => {\n  const visitTime = new Date();\n  console.log(`visited ${req.url} at ${visitTime.toLocaleString()}`);\n  next();\n};\n\napp.use(myLogger);\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nAs you can imagine it can be very useful to write your own Middleware, but you can also find many useful middleware to add to your program for rapid development.\nWorkshop\nFork and Clone the express-workshop-2 repository\nLet's have a look at the repo we've just forked.\n\nPackage.json: Remember how in the last lesson we added a package.json\nfile and added dependencies like express to it.\n\nWhat command did we use to create a package.json file\nHow did we add dependencies to it?\n\nToday, the project comes with a package file already - this lists all the\npackages we need to run the project (instead of adding installed packages to\nthe Git repo, which would take up a lot of memory, we just declare a list of\ndependencies in package.json). Now, we can run npm install, and the\ndependencies will be installed.\n\nServer.js - this is the entry point for our application. Let's walk\nthrough the code and remember what it does.\n\nWhat is Express Static Middleware used for?\nWhat routes are defined?\nWhat Port does the server run on?\n\n\n\nLet's run the server and check it in the browser. This is what you should see on your browser:\n\n\nThe theme used for this website is based on Bootstrap. You can get more open\nsource Bootsrap-based themes from\nStartBootstrap\n\n\nExercise: Notice how the link to Contact me doesn't return a page -\nLet's add an enpoint to return a simple string this is a contact page.\n\nTemplating\nOnce you have forked the repository, let's take a look at using templates\n\nExercise: Let's change the text for the link, Contact, to Contact\nInformation.\nHow many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.\n\nAt the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the public folder.\nNodeJS and ExpressJS allows us to build dynamic web pages.\n\nA server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled\nby an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side\nscripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page\nproceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nTemplate Engines\nA template engine enables you to use static template files in your application.\nAt runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with\nactual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.\nThis approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate\ncode (DRY).\nSome popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustache,\nand EJS.\nHandlebars Templating Engine\nWe will use Handlebars as the\ntemplating engine for this class.\nTo add it to your project: npm install --save express-handlebars\nThen in your server.js, we need to configure the middleware for Handlebars.\n// Add this to the top of your file\nconst exphbs = require(\"express-handlebars\");\n\n// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app\napp.engine(\"handlebars\", exphbs({ defaultLayout: \"main\" }));\napp.set(\"view engine\", \"handlebars\");\n\n\nLet's look at the folder views/layouts/main.handlebars\n\n\nThere is a placeholder for body where the \"body\" get injected - can you\nfind it?\nNotice the index.handlebars, my-cv.handlebars and admin.handlebars.\n\nThen add these routes:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add similar endpoints for /my-cv and /admin.\nExercise: Let's create a template called contact and delete the endpoint\nwe created earlier for /contact - render a view instead - similar to what we\ndid with the previous endpoints.\nExercise: Remember how we changed Contact to Contact Information?\nTry to change now Contact Information to Get in touch. Was it any\neasier?\n\nTemplate passing info from Controller to Template\nWhen we were using the static HTML pages from public/ folder - the heading\ntext shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to\ndifferent pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior\nas the code for this part comes from the centralised Layout\n(views/layouts/main.handlebars).\nHow can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve\nstatic files? Express and Handlebars allow you to pass data between the\nroutes and the views. Here is how we can do it:\n\nLet's modify the / route to pass the title of the page.\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  res.render(\"index\", {\n    title: \"Etzali Profile\" // insert your name instead\n  });\n});\n\n\nIn /views/layouts/main.handlebars, let's use the data we're passing to the\ntemplate\n\n    \n        \n            \n            \n            \n            A modern Website built in Node\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Pass the subheading from the route to the view as well.\nExercise: Change Title to default to \"My Profile\" if no title was\nprovided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars\nhttp://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html\n\nPartials\nHandlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal\nHandlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates.\n(Handlebars documentation)\nLet's put the Menu in a partial.\n\nGo to layout/main.handlebars and cut the  with all its contents, and\nmove it to a new file called menu.handlebars under views/partials.\n\nThen to use the partial, add {{> menu}} in the place where you cut the\noriginal menu from.\nMore Templating\nThere is much more that can be done with Handlebars templating engine. Skim\nthrough the express-handlebars\nand handlebars documentation\nFor now, we will finish by using the each helper.\nDynamically loading the templates\n{{#each posts}}\n    \n        \n            \n                {{this.title}}\n            \n            \n                {{this.summary}}\n            \n        \n    \n{{/each}}\n\nIn the route, let's load the file in data/posts.json:\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  const filePath = __dirname + \"/data/posts.json\";\n  const callbackFunction = (error, file) => {\n    // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String\n    const fileData = file.toString();\n    // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String\n    const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);\n    // send the json to the Template to render\n    res.render(\"index\", {\n      title: \"Etzali Profile\", // insert your name instead\n      posts: postsJson\n    });\n  };\n  fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);\n});\n\nCallbacks\nIn JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in\na first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We\ncan pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript\nfor dealing with asynchronous behaviour. We have in fact already encountered\ncallbacks when we looked at array methods such as .forEach(), .map() and\n.filter().\nconst evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];\nevenNumbers.forEach(num => {\n  console.log(num);\n});\n\nHere we are passing the function (num) { console.log(num); } function as an\nargument to .forEach() to execute with each item in the array evenNumbers.\nThe above example is synchronous which means that code the callback is\nexecuted immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed\nasynchronously. We will use a setTimeout function to delay execution here.\nIn most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response\nto an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look\nat both of those cases in detail in a future class.\nfunction delay(callback) {\n  setTimeout(callback, 2000);\n}\n\nfunction logRandom() {\n  const value = Math.round(Math.random() * 10);\n  console.log(value);\n  return value;\n}\n\ndelay(logRandom);\n\nKey points\n\nFunctions can be passed as arguments to other other function\nFunctions that are passed as arguments are called callbacks\nCallbacks may be executed immediately or later\nIf a callback is executed later, its return value is lost\n\n\nExercise: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the\nNode code we've written?\nExercise: On the CV page, there is a button, Get Repos List, that\ndoesn't work. There is code to make it work at js\\github-client.js. Add\njs\\github-client.js to your pages.\n\nThe client-side code in github-client.js should look familiar.\n\nExercise: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the\nanonymous functions to their own variables and use the variables instead.\n(Bonus point if you use arrow functions)\n\nCallback hell\nIn the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a\nrequirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to\nretrieve all the available branches (there is a property called branches_url\nthat we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make\nanother API call to get the info for each branch.\nThe code to do so, will look something similar to this:\nvar oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\noReq.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n  var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n    var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq2.addEventListener(\"load\", function() {\n      // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.\n    });\n    oReq3.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_INFO_URL); // 3. third url for branch info\n    oReq3.send();\n  });\n  oReq.open(\"GET\", BRANCH_URL); // 2. second url for branches\n  oReq.send();\n});\noReq.open(\"GET\", REPO_URL); // 1. first url for Repo\noReq.send();\n\nThe code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape\n}) - This is often called the callback hell.\nAPIs\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to\ncommunicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:\nGithub API. We managed to communicate with Github and get important\ninformation. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different\nways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a\nMobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...\n\nLet's watch this video about APIs -\nWhat is an API\nExercise: Let's expose the posts.json as an API for other clients to\nconsume through the url /api/get-posts. Hint: make use res.sendFile\n\nREST API\nREST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a convention and architecture for building APIs that is simple and scalable.\nThere are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one\nfundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP\nMethods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)\nIn our endpoint that we just created /api/get-posts, the get part of the\nURL is redundant as the HTTP Method GET already tells that we are GETting a\nResource. The Resource in this case is called posts.\n\nExercise: Let's rename our endpoint to /posts so that it follows RESTful\narchitecture.\nWhat would the endpoint for creating posts be called?\nWatch: What is a REST API\n(up to 3 minutes)\n\nREST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia\nshows how a typical RESTful API would look like.\n\nWikipedia\nFor now, remember when building APIs, to use Resource names to identify your\nendpoints and make use of the HTTP methods (Verbs) to describe operations\nperformed on those resources.\nDeploying to Heroku\nHeroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build,\ndeliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and\nscale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to\nfocus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers,\nhardware, or infrastructure.\n\nSignup for an account on Heroku\nIt will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a\nvalid email\n\n\nDownload the Heroku CLI\nWe need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.\n\nOn server.js, add the process.env.PORT bit of code\napp.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\nThis tells our server to look for an environment variable called PORT and\nuse it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on\nheroku, then Heroku sets the PORT to the correct value.\ngit add and commit your change.\n\nNow open the command line in the folder where you have your\nexpress-workshop repo running. If you run the command git remote -v,\nyou should see one remote origin pointing to your repo.\n\nRun these commands:\nheroku login\n\nThis will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to\nregister.\n\nOnce you're logged in:\nheroku create\n\nThe heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a\ngit remote that must be used to receive your application source.\n\nIf you check git remote -v, you should see a second remote called heroku.\nNow push your code to heroku git push heroku master. The push will run few\ncommands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to\nhttps://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com - go to the URL and if all goes\nwell, your app should be up and running.\nTo read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check:\n\nDeploying with Git\nGetting Started on Heroku with Node.js\n\nHomework\n\nDeploy to Heroku if you haven't yet\nAdd a route posts/:postid that displays a specific post - Read about route\nparameters on\nExpress documentation\nWhen the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your\nroute.\nAmend your JSON structure to have a postId that you can use it to\nidentify which post we want to display.\n\n\nImplement the Admin page.\nWrite a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON\nfile (use the helper functions we added under helpers/savePost)\nMake an AJAX call from the front end (the admin page) to your new\nendpoint.\nYou might need to use formidable or body-parser middleware to get the\ndata on the server.\n\n\nConsume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to\ndisplay their latest blog posts.

This is fine and works well for some data - particularly simple data -\nbut it can quickly cause issues with your data.\nTEACHER STORY:\nBack in 2013 I used to work for a company that ran hotel wifi systems for five star hotels.\nWe did Intercontinentals, Sheratons, Marriotts and a whole bunch of others. This company had been\ngoing for a long time and hails back to the times when wifi used to be very expensive.\nThe code for this system had the notion of \"invoices\", \"wifi enrollments\" and \"guests\" and\nstored data on each. We would store data on each and we would run reports on each and send them\nto the hotels who would use them to bill guests.\nAll fine so far. Except we would sometimes send reports with invoices which didn't have enrollments,\nenrollments which didn't have guests. Sometimes the amounts on those invoices would rack up to\ntens even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Of invoices without customers.\nThis was how the face of the hotel manager looked:\n\nThis was a very, very serious problem. We were >.\nThis was a problem because our system was buggy, so we had what are generally called \"data integrity\"\nissues. Data integrity issues are like normal bugs except much, much worse. You can almost always fix\na normal bug. For bad data the chances are you will never fix it.\nThese lessons are about storing and retrieving data safely such that you won't have the same problems\nI did.\nLESSON 1B : What is the point of an SQL database?\nWe're going to teach you a new programming language. It's called SQL. Pronounced \"S - Q - L\" or sequel, either is fine.\nDatabases are simply programs that take data and stuff it in files just like you were doing in the previous lesson.\nHowever, the way we use a database is different to the way we store things in files. In a file, you can put any random jumble of data in and get it out again. How you put it in and get it out is up to you. Your code needs to open the file, close the file, retrieve, store or modify and validate everything itself. Offloading some of that responsibility to another program means that your code can achieve all the same things but be simpler.\nYou interact with almost all of them using the same programming language which is called \"SQL\". It's been around for 31 years and is still completely dominant. Computing moves fast, but SQL doesn't change. This kind of lesson will probably still be taught in 50 years. Probably 4 out of 5 software jobs involve SQL In some way.\nSQL is a different, and usually simpler kind of programming language that you use with a database (sometimes called an RDBMS) to:\n\nStore data in a way such that its structure cannot be violated.\n\nRetrieve data (get me all the reservations under the name \"Trump\") and answer questions about data (\"what was the sum total of all of the invoices in february?\").\n\n\nAn RDBMS (relational database management system) will do this by, for example:\n\nData constraints (e.g. each reservation must have a customer)\nData types (e.g. check in date can only be a date)\nUniqueness of certain pieces of data (e.g. there is only one person with the driver's license ID 941413).\nOrganizing how the data is retrieved and assembled (e.g. fetch me all reservations under customer \"Donald Trump\").\nExecutes on a different process/machine, meaning that the queries can be parallelized, and work can be offloaded from the main server.\n\nEXERCISE 1B: INSTALLING SQLITE ON YOUR LAPTOP AND CREATING YOUR FIRST DATABASE\nThe RDBMS we are going to teach you first is called \"sqlite\". It's pretty much the industry standard for creating small, self contained database that fit in one file - quite a common task.\n\nWindows: https://sqlite.org/download.html\nUbuntu: apt-get install sqlite\nMac OS: brew install sqlite\n\nTo run SQLite, open a command prompt and run \"sqlite mydatabase.sqlite\".\nThis should give you a prompt like this:\nSQLite version 2.8.17\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\nsqlite>\n\nThis is a command prompt where you can run snippets of SQL and load files containing SQL.\nLESSON 1C: CREATING A TABLE\nThe first thing we want to store is customers, since without customers, you don't have a hotel.\nFirst, open a file in any text editor and put the following in a file called 'hotel.sql':\ncreate table customers (\n    title varchar,\n    firstname varchar,\n    surname varchar\n);\n\ninsert into customers (title, firstname, surname, email) values ('Mr', 'Donald', 'Trump');\n\nWhat we have here:\n\nCreating a table - this creates the structure which you can use to put data in. The items are columns.\nInsert into - puts data into that structure.\nSelect * from - gets the entire contents of that table.\n\n'title varchar' - this means we're creating a column with the name 'title' which holds a 'variable number of characters'. This is pretty much the same thing as a string in javascript.\n\n\nNow, in the command prompt run the following:\n$ sqlite mydatabase.sqlite\n\nsqlite> .read hotel.sql\nNow that the file has been loaded with one table containing one row of data, you can read it back\nout again like this:\nWhat to put on the right hand side (data retrieval):\nsqlite> select * from customers;\n\nNow that you've done all that, DELETE the mydatabase.sqlite file, run it again and make sure you get the same result again.\nEXERCISE 1C: Create tables and insert data\n\nAmend hotel.sql create the database again and add yourselves as second customer using INSERT - so you're now staying in a hotel with Donald Trump. Run select * and ensure that you see yourself both as guests. Then delete mydatabase.sqlite again.\n\nChange hotel.sql again to store email addresses from yourself and Donald (donald.trump@whitehouse.gov) and have them displayed on screen. Run select * and ensure you are both guests. Then delete mydatabase.sqlite again.\n\nChange hotel.sql again. Add teacher - \"Colm OConner\" - as your third customer. My email address is \"colm.oconner.github@gmail.com\".\n\n\nLESSON 1D: Data types\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 3444.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 3445.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nAnd in the command box:\nsqlite>  select * from invoices\n\nWhat we have here:\n\nAn 'integer', a 'number', a 'datetime' and a boolean. These are all analogous to data types which you have learned about in javascript but there are sometimes subtle differences that you will eventually run in to.\n\nFor \"paid\" which is either yes or no - we have a default of 'no' - it's saying that if you insert data and don't specify 'paid' as a column when you INSERT data, it will assume you meant 'no'.\n\nFor 'invoice_date_time' you must store the data in the form of a combination of date and time. It has a 'not null' constraint which means that you have to give a datetime when you insert data, it will refuse to let you insert an invoice without specifying invoice_date_time and refuse to let you explicitly give your invoice_date_time as null.\n\n\nFurther reading : https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html\n\nEXERCISE 1D : Data types\nIn your \"hotel.sql\" create a reservations table with columns for customer ID, room ID, check in date, check out date and price per night and insert a bunch of example data - maybe you and 10 friends or celebrities.\nThe hotel manager has told you:\n\nCustomers do have to give a check in date, but they don't have to give a check out date.\nReservations need a customer ID and a room ID\nReservations have a check in date, a check out date and a price per night.\n\nLESSON 1E : SELECT\nCurrently we've just put data in to a table and gotten all of it out. What about if we only want specific data?\nFor this we will introduce a SQL key word called 'WHERE'.\nLets go back to the invoices table. Make your SQL files have a create table for invoices in like this:\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\nAnd put in a bunch of data like this:\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (150, 431.50, '03/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (155, 300.50, '04/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (156, 284.35, '04/01/2017', 1);\n\nSo, if you do a regular query you just get all of the data:\nselect * from invoices\n\nIf you do \nselect * from invoices where reservation_id = 123;\n\nselect * from invoices where invoice_date_time \nEXERCISE 1F : SELECT\nWrite SQL for the following:\n\nWhich invoices were paid?\n\nWhich invoices were for under 300 pounds?\n\nWhich invoices paid on 3rd January 2017 or after?\n\n\nLESSON 1G : Primary Keys\nOk, now we're going to introduce a problem. Let's say a secretary types in a bunch of invoice IDs and values:\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (123, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nselect * from invoices;\n\nQUESTION FOR CLASS : What is the problem here? [ A business calls up and says they need to pay invoice 123 ]\nWe solve this problem with something called a \"primary key\" - what this does is make it so the database will absolutely refuse to accept a number if you enter in a duplicate.\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017');\n\nTry entering an invoice with ID 123 now:\nsqlite> insert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (123, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (999, 250.50, '03/01/2017');\n\nNow, picking primary keys is a tricky problem. You need to make sure that you pick some kind of\nidentifier which you know will always be unique.\nQUESTION FOR CLASS:\n\nIs first name a good candidate for a primary key?\nIs first name and surname together a good candidate for a primary key?\nIs a driver's license ID a good candidate for a primary key? [ if and only if everybody is from the same country ]\nIs a passport ID a good candidate for a primary key? [ if and only if everybody is from europe ]\nIs just coming up with an arbitrary number that is unique a good candidate for a primary key?\n\nLESSON 1H: AUTOINCREMENTING PRIMARY KEYS\nWe still have a problem here. Joe the office manager who is entering invoices doesn't really want to \nkeep coming up with random numbers every time he enters an invoice. Why not just get the database to give\nus an ID?\nWe can do that with a magic feature called autoincrementing numbers. You don't specify the ID and the\ndatabase will just give your row a new ID. What ID will it give it? The ID of the last row plus one.\ncreate table invoices (\n    reservation_id      integer primary key autoincrement,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into invoices (total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (143.50, '01/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (total, invoice_date_time) values (250.50, '02/01/2017');\n\nNOTE: the word 'autoincrement' and the lack of ID specified in the insert statement.\nEXERCISE 1H : Primary Keys\n\nRecreate customer table with a primary key. Bear in mind that you don't have a driver's license or passport ID.\n\nRecreate reservations table with a primary key.\n\n\nLESSON 1I : Foreign keys\nNow, as we've seen two tables that have an intrinsic relationship to one another. Every invoice has\na reservation ID.\ncreate table reservations (\n  `id`                    integer primary key autoincrement,\n  `customer_id`           integer,\n  `room_id`               integer,\n  `check_in_date`         datetime not null,\n  `checkout_out_date`,    datetime,\n  `room_price_per_night`  real\n);\n\ncreate table invoices (\n    id                  integer primary key autoincrement,\n    reservation_id      integer,\n    total               number,\n    invoice_date_time   datetime not null,\n    paid                boolean default false\n);\n\ninsert into reservations (customer_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, room_price_per_night) values (123, 55, '01/01/2017', '02/01/2017', 100);\n\ninsert into reservations (customer_id, room_id, check_in_date, check_out_date, room_price_per_night) values (124, 55, '03/01/2017', '05/01/2017', 100);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time, paid) values (123, 100, '03/01/2017', 1);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 50, '06/01/2017', 0);\n\ninsert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (124, 50, '06/01/2017', 1);\n\nPoint out that the reservation ID corresponds with the ID on the reservations table.\nsqlite> insert into invoices (reservation_id, total, invoice_date_time) values (125, 50, '06/01/2017);\n\nQUESTION FOR CLASS: What's the problem with the last statement? \nA: Invoice isn't going to get paid because we don't know who it's for.\nTo fix this problem we place an additional restriction on the data - you can only add IDs that exist to columns referencing other tables.\n\ncreate table reservations (\n  `id`                    integer primary key autoincrement,\n  `customer_id`           integer,\n  `room_id`               integer,\n  `check_in_date`         datetime not null,\n  `checkout_out_date`,    datetime,\n  `room_price_per_night`  real\n);\n\ncreate table invoices (\n    id                           integer primary key autoincrement,\n    foreign key(reservation_id)  references reservations(reservation_id),\n    total                        number,\n    invoice_date_time            datetime not null,\n    paid                         boolean default false\n);\n\nEXERCISE 1I : Foreign keys\n\nChange the file to insert the data from above without IDs.\n\nChange the file to add foreign key relationship for reservations table and customers table.\n\n\nLESSON 1J : Updating data\nLet's say that we made a mistake with one of the invoices created above.\nFirst get the ID of an invoice entered earlier:\nsqlite> select * from invoices where invoice_date_time = '01/01/2017';\n\nIf you want to change this invoice to be £300, you need to use 'UPDATE'.\nsqlite> update invoices where id = [ ID FROM ABOVE ] set room_price_per_night = 300.0;\n\nEXERCISE 1J : Updating data\n\nRun SQL from lesson 1C where my surname was entered as OConner. My name is actually O'Connor. Fix it using 'UPDATE'.\n\n"},"node-db/week-17/lesson.html":{"url":"node-db/week-17/lesson.html","title":"Week 17 - SQL with Node","keywords":"","body":"LESSON 2: LINKING JAVASCRIPT AND SQL\nReview of last lesson\nWhat we did last lesson:\n\nWhy we need databases\nInstalling SQLite\nCreating a database with SQL and storing data in it.\nInserting data into a database using SQL.\nRetrieving data from a database using SQL.\nEscaping (who figured out how to insert my real name into the database?)\n\nHomework from last lesson:\n\n\nDid you do update?\nDid everybody finish hotel.sql so that it looks like the above diagram?\nAbout those foreign key constraints that weren't being enforced on SQLite -- enforce PRAGMA and version\nDid we understand foreign keys?\nDoes everybody have enough data in their database?

There is a TRAP in one of these user stories we will be giving you today.\nWhat is the difference between user story, use case and user acceptance test. \n\nSHOULD I USE SQL OR SHOULD I USE NOSQL?\nShort answer: if in doubt, you should just use SQL. Always.\nLong answer: There are two forms of NoSQL.\n1) Extremely high scale -- Cassandra --- constraints are not enforced due to high load and high levels of data.\n2) For beginner programmers - Mongo --- constraints (among other features) are not there to simplify things for beginners.\nThis lesson will primarily be about taking what you have stored in a flat file, and changing it such that it is stored in a database instead. This will be done to appease Marriott hotel manager grumpy cat. With all the constraints you have already added to the database, on your hotel.sql file, the application should be much safer now - if you screw up (and you will, because bugs are as inevitable as taxes), you can see the bugs getting deployed before they start affecting guests.\nUse /server/class2.js for the exercises of this class.\nSetting up the environment\nTask Clone the repo, and follow the instructions to set the environment up.\nYou have already worked with back end servers using Express. This is just another yet another one, that we will be connecting to a database.\nIn order for us to interact with the server, we are going to use Postman, which will accurately mimic API calls made from react. In the last three lessons you're going to make react do to this back end what postman is going to do today.\nWe're going to use it for debugging. Can anybody tell me what debugging is?\n\n\nTask Download and install Postman.\nNow let us all try Postman by GETting from http://localhost:8080/api/customers, as is shown next.\n\nLESSON 1: SELECT ALL THE THINGS!\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to be able to view a list of customers so that I can see who has visited our hotel.\nUse case When a user does a GET request to /customers it should return customer titles, first names, surnames.\nUser acceptance test: Do a GET request and get back [{\"title\": \"mr\", \"firstname\": \"Donald\", \"surname\": \"Trump\"}, {\"title\": \"Mrs\", \"firstname\": \"Hillary\", \"surname\": \"Clinton\"}]\nRemove the code that is returning a JSON object on end point /customers, and use what you have learned about to SQL to fill in the query that fetches all the customers from the database.\n\nselect everything\n\nconst filename = './database/database.sqlite';\nconst sqlite3    = require('sqlite3').verbose();\nlet db = new sqlite3.Database(filename);\n\nrouter.get('/customers', function(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({\n    customers: [{\n      id: 2,\n      title: 'Mr',\n      firstname: 'Laurie',\n      surname: 'Ainley',\n      email: 'laurie@ainley.com'\n    }\n  ]});\n})\n\nWho can tell me what this is currently doing? What do we need to make it do?\nSo, the answer is here:\nrouter.get('/customers', function(req, res) {\n  res.status(200).json({\n    db.all(sql, [], (err, 'select * from customers' ) => {\n      res.status(200).json({\n        customers: rows\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nExercise 1\nUser Story: As a staff member I need to check the details of a given customer given its id.\nUser Acceptance test: Complete the end-point /customers/:id, so that it extracts that customer information from the database, and replies back with that information as JSON.\n\nselect and filter by id\nhint: simple select and filter by ID\n\nSTRETCH GOAL (OPTIONAL) : If you get a request of /customers/notanumber (anything that isn't a number) it should return an HTTP 400 bad request.\nLESSON 2 : LIKE, WHATEVER\nSo, now we're going to deal with one of the most common issues with hotel databases: the guest's name being misspelled.\nSo, \"Hilary Clinten\" is added to the database. She calls up on the phone asking about her reservation and spells her name correctly on the phone. The hotel staff knows what some of her name sounds like but not all of it and they want to find her as a customer on the system.\nFor this problem where we want to search in part of a string we use the LIKE command:\nselect * from customers where surname like '%lint%';\n\nThis returns all of the customers who have the name 'lint' in their names.\nselect * from customers where surname like '%clint%';\n\nThis won't return anything at all. Why not?\nselect * from customers where surname ilike '%clint%';\n\nThis will.

Either a) delete the reservation as well? or b) raise an error and force the user to delete the data manually if they really want him gone.\n\nWhat if you want to undo the deletion?\n\nWhat if you want to mark some data as deleted but you might still want to refer to it?\n\nOften it's a good idea to give data the 'status' deleted instead of actually deleting it.\n\n\nHOMEWORK 6\nUser Story: As a staff member, I want to delete a canceled reservation from the database.\nNotes on Postman\nThe delete request is actually pretty straight forward.

By default GitHub repos prevent most people from pushing to them. This is ensure that repo owners have control over the project.\nThis doesn't mean you will never be able to make changes to the repo! On GitHub you do this by creating a \"fork\". A fork is an exact copy of the original repo but copied to your own GitHub account. This means that now you can push to it!\nThis is why you will need to create a fork when submitting a PR for your homework.\nWhat is a remote?\nGit has a concept of a \"remote\". These are other git repositories that can be connected to over the internet. You can push or pull code changes from them. Remotes have a name and a URL. Most of the remotes that you will use at CYF are hosted on GitHub, so have a github.com URL.\nWhen you clone a repo from GitHub, the default remote is named origin and the URL is set to that of the GitHub repo.\nYou can view the remotes you have set up with:\ngit remote -v\nHow to fork a GitHub repo\nFirstly you need to click the \"Fork\" button:\n\nThen you should be brought to your new fork (notice how the repo title changes):\n\nNow you can clone from your fork by copying the URL here:\n\nThe command to clone is:\ngit clone URL_YOU_JUST_COPIED\nAdding a Remote\nFollow these instructions if you are getting an permission error when pushing your changes. If you have cloned the original repo before forking, you'll need to follow these instructions. You can check this by running git remote -v. If the output looks something like:\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (fetch)\norigin git@github.com:CodeYourFuture/css-skin.git (push)\nthen you have cloned before forking. The key is that the origin remote is pointing to a CodeYourFuture URL. Don't worry, we can fix it!\nThe first step is to fork the original repo. Follow the first 2 steps from forking instructions above.\nNow, instead of cloning the fork (you have already cloned), you need to add it as a remote.\nRun:\ngit remote add fork URL_YOU_COPIED_FROM_FORK\nThis will add a new remote called fork that points to your new fork. To check this, run git remote -v again. You should see both the origin and fork remotes.\nNow that you have your fork remote you can push to it (instead of the origin remote, which will error) by running:\ngit push fork\nYou'll need to remember to add the fork every time you push.\nCreating a PR\nSo you've done your homework, you've committed your changes and are ready to make a PR. Congrats! &#x1F389;&#x1F389;&#x1F389;\nAt this point you should have followed the instructions either to fork the original repo or added a remote to your fork. If you haven't make sure you read those sections first.\nYou will need to push to your fork. If you forked and then cloned (as in the how to fork instructions) then you just need to run git push. If you added a remote to your fork, then you will need to run git push fork.\nNext you need to go the original repo in your browser (probably starting with https://github.com/CodeYourFuture). Next click the Pull Requests tab:\n\nThen click the New pull request button:\n\nThen click the \"compare across forks\" link:\n\nThen click the \"head fork\" dropdown button:\n\nThen find your fork in the list and click it:\n\nThen click the Create pull request button:\n\nAlmost there! Now fill out the PR form. Give it a sensible title and an (optional) description:\n\nAnd finally click the Create pull request button at the bottom of the form:\n\nThat's it!

Explain the benefits of well named methods in\nprogramming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.\n\nGetting started with JavaScript\nWe will spend most of this lesson in Codepen. To get started, go to\ncodepen.io/pen/ to create a new Pen. On the bottom left,\nclick the \"Console\" button to open the console.\n\nYou can place your cursor right behind the > sign. Type a simple expression,\nsuch as 2 + 2 and hit enter. You will see expression, as well as its result,\nin the window above.\n\nYou will be able to follow most of this session along just entering expressions\nin the console like this.\nVariables and assignments\nFor an expression or a value to be of any use to us, we need to store it in a\nvariable.\nVariables have a name (identifier) that we can use to refer to a value. You\ncan assign a value to a variable with the following statement:\nvar x = 3;\n^   ^ ^ ^\n|   | | value\n|   | assignment operator\n|   identifier\ndeclaration statement\nLet’s break this statement down:\n\nvar: With the var statement we tell the JavaScript engine that x is now\na variable\nx: The variable name/identifier. It can be short or long, but must not\ncontain spaces and must not start with a number.\n=: The equal sign is the assigmnent operator\n3: The value that we assign to the variable. This can be any number, string\nor boolean, or any more complex data type that we will introduce later. You\ncan also use an existing variable here.\n;: THe semicolon is not strictly needed, but is generally used to terminate\na statement.\n\nNow you can use the identifier instead of the actual value in an expression:\nx + x, x * x, console.log(x)\nSimple data types & Expressions\nNumbers\nLet’s start with something seemingly simple - numbers. Here are some:\n1;\n15;\n3195803798;\n1.4;\n0.0000005;\n0 - 23;\n\nYou will see that there are whole numbers (no decimal point) and real numbers\n(decimal point), which in JavaScript are so-called “floating point” numbers.\nNumbers can be positive or negative and they support all the basic math\noperators that you would expect:\n2 + 2; // 4\n2 - 5; // -3\n2 * 3; // 6\n10 / 2; // 5\n3 * -2; // -6\n\nOperators have the same precedence as in algebra: * and / have higher\nprecedence than + and -.\n\nTODO: Do math exercise\nTODO: What about Infinity, Math.PI, IEEE floating point bullshit, NaN\n\nStrings\nStrings represent any sort of text. They are delimited by single quotes (') or\ndouble quotes (”) and can be of any length.\n'' // empty string\n\"\" // empty string\n'Hello'\n'I am learning JavaScript'\n'It\\'s been a great journey so far!'\n\"Double quotes work as well\"\n\nIf you need single or double quotes inside the string, you need to “escape”\nthem by putting a backslash in front of them. If you don’t do this, the\nJavaScript engine will think the string ends here, because it encounters a\nquote.\n\nThe most common operation on strings is to append one string to another. This is\ncalled string concatenation. It’s achieved by the plus (+) operator:\n\"Hello\" + \"World\" // \"HelloWorld\"\n\nTODO: Introduce string concatenation\nTODO: What about basic string functions, like substr, replace etc?\n\nBooleans\nBooleans are a data type that\ncan only have two values: true and false.\nLike numbers, they can be combined using operators, but there are different\noperators for booleans (analoguous to\nBoolean algebra). The most\nimportant ones are:\n\n! (NOT), which negates a value:\n\n!true; // false\n!false; // true\n\n\n&& (AND), which is only true if both operands are true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // false\nfalse && true; // false\ntrue && true; // true\n\n\n|| (OR), which is true if at least one of the operands is true:\n\nfalse && false; // false\ntrue && false; // true\nfalse && true; // true\ntrue && true; // true\n\nTODO: When to introduce truthiness and falsiness? Probably in comparisons?\n\n\nExercise: Put simple mathematical expressions into the console: 2 * 2,\n2 + 2, 5 * 7 - 13 > Exercise: Calculate the area of a circle (r * r *\npi).

Move it to the JS box in Codepen\nNow you don't get any immediate feedback\nUse console.log to print to the console: console.log(3 + 3);\nWrite statements below each other\n\n\nTHOUGHT: Codepen does not have a \"run\" button, so it's quite intransparent\nwhen it actually re-runs a program.

If you want to share your project with others, you need to\nhave a list of the things you installed, so that other people know what to\ninstall in order to run the project.\nIn Node.js, this 'list' file is called a package.json. The 'things you've\ninstalled' are referred to as dependencies. Creating this file is the first\nstep in setting up your Node.js project.\n1. Make a package.json file\nLet's start by creating the package.json file. We can add things to it as the\nproject grows. The package.json file is easy to create from the command line.\nType the following command into your terminal to get started:\n$ npm init\n\nThis command will initialise a step-by-step process for creating the\npackage.json. You should see something like this:\n\nIt will ask you a bunch of questions.\n\nYou can skip most of the questions but change the entry point from\n(index.js) to server.js.\nThe wizard asks you for the following information: name, version,\ndescription, main, test, repository, keywords, author, license -\ndo you understand all of them?\n\nAt the endo of the wizard, you should see a new file called package.json in\nyour project's folder.\nHere is an example package.json file for a project called\nPassport.\nWhat is JSON?\nJSON is a type of file for structuring data in a readable way. It is also a\nreally popular format for sending data across the web. JSON is a string\nrepresentation of a Javascript object. JSON objects convert really easily to\nJavascript objects, and vice versa, with JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"isAlive\": true,\n  \"age\": 25,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"streetAddress\": \"21 2nd Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New York\",\n    \"state\": \"NY\",\n    \"postalCode\": \"10021-3100\"\n  },\n  \"phoneNumbers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"home\",\n      \"number\": \"212 555-1234\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"office\",\n      \"number\": \"646 555-4567\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"mobile\",\n      \"number\": \"123 456-7890\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"children\": [],\n  \"spouse\": null\n}\n\nStep 2 - Installing Express\nBefore we write any code, you'll need to install the Express library. We're\ngoing to use the Node Package Manager (npm) to\ndownload it using the npm install command.\nNPM is the place to go to download other Node code written by other people.\nThere are thousands of open-source, 3rd-party Node modules (also known as\n\"packages\") by other people that you can download and use in your own projects.\nAs we install Express, we'll need to update the package.json to add Express as\na dependency. We do this so that other people working on the project will know\nto install Express before running any of the code. This can be done by adding\n--save to the end of your command.\nRun the following command in your terminal:\nnpm install express --save\n\nExpress should now be installed. Check your package.json file to make sure it\nhas been added as a dependency. It will look like this:\n\nStep 3 - Building the server\nThe first thing we need to do is build our server. You will always need to build\na server when writing back-end code. A server can be built in pure Node.js, but\nExpress gives us simpler syntax to work with.\n1. Create a server.js file\nLet's build our server! Before we do anything, let's create a new file called\nserver.js. This is where all our server code is going to live.\n2. require the express library\nWe already installed Express in Step 2, but we need to make sure it is included\nin this file specifically so we can make use of its methods. In Node.js, when\nyou want to access the functionality of a library or module in another file, you\nrequire it.\nTo import Express, write the following inside server.js:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\n\n\nWe will try and get used to ES6 syntax - so use const and let instead of\nvar.\n\n3. Initialise the server\nTo initialise our server, we just need to call the express() function. This\nwill create an Express application for us to work with.\nAdd the second line of code to your server.js file:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\n4. Start 'listening' for potential requests\nOne more step left, we need to set a port for our server to listen to. Think\nof a port as a door number; any requests that come to the server will come via\nthat door. Setting a port will allow us to find where our server is running.\nWe use the app.listen method to do this. This method takes two arguments:\na port and a callback function telling it what to do once the server is\nrunning. Need clarification? Read more about the app.listen method in the\nExpress documentation.\nWe're going to run our server on port 3000, and run a simple console.log as\nour callback function. Update your server.js file, calling the app.listen\nmethod:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nTry to use ES6 arrow functions instead of function.\n\n5. Switch the server on!\nYou've built your server, but it isn't running yet. We need to run a command in\nthe terminal to do this. We are going to use the node keyword to run the\nserver file.\nType the following command in your terminal:\nnode server.js\n\nIf you see this, congratulations! You have built yourself a server!\n\nStep 4 - Communicating with the server\nNow that we've built the server, we need to communicate with it. We're going to\ncontrol the server with handler functions.\nWhat is a handler function?\nWhen a request reaches the server, we need a way of responding to it. In comes\nthe handler function. The handler function is just a function which receives\nrequests and handles them, hence the name.\nThe handler function always takes a request and response object, and sends\nthe response back to the client along with some information. You can decide what\nto send back in your response.\nWhat does a handler function look like in Express?\nThe get() method is used to\ndefine a handler function in Express. It takes two parameters: the endpoint\nat which to trigger an action (we'll explain more about this in the next step),\nand the handler function that tells it exactly what to do. Here's a simple\n\"Hello World!\" example:\n// req is the Request object, res is the Response object\n// (these are just variable names, they can be anything but it's a convention to call them req and res)\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\nHere, we are telling our server to respond with \"Hello World!\" when someone\ntries to access the webpage.\n1. Create your own handler function.\nWe are now making a handler function with a custom message in our response. You\ncan write any message you want.\nUpdate your server.js file with an empty app.get() function:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Try to console.log the request object inside the handler\nfunction. Restart your server, refresh the browser, then go to your terminal\nto see what it looks like. You should see a lot of data come through.\n\n2. Tell your handler function what to do\nWe want our handler function to send back a message to the client. To do that,\nwe're going to use the Express send()\nmethod. This will update the\nresponse object with the message.\nUpdate your handler function like so:\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Yay Node Girls!\");\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, function() {\n  console.log(\"Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!\");\n});\n\n3. Check it out in your browser\nQuit your server in the terminal with ctrl + c. Then restart it to run your\nnew changes.\nnode server.js\n\nNow, open your favourite browser (we like Chrome), and navigate to\nhttp://localhost:3000. If you see your message in the browser,\ncongratulations! You just sent your first response from the server.\nStep 5 - Routing\nAt the moment our server only does one thing. When it receives a request from\nthe / endpoint, it sends back the same response: \"Yay Node Girls!\".\n\nTry typing http://localhost:3000/nodegirls and see what happens.\n\nHowever by making use of endpoints, we can make the server send different\nresponses for different requests. This concept is called routing.\nWhat is an endpoint?\nAn endpoint is the part of the URL which comes after /. For example:\n/chocolate is the \"chocolate\" endpoint. It's the URL to which you send a\nrequest.\nWhat is URL?\n\n1. Create your own endpoints and send different responses\nWe're going to try sending different responses at different endpoints. Remember\nthe app.get() method? To set up routing in your server, we just need to repeat\nthis method with different endpoints.\nFor example:\napp.get(\"/\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello World!\");\n});\n\napp.get(\"/chocolate\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Mm chocolate :O\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: Add some code so that your server sends one message when the\nendpoint is /node and another one when it's /girls.\n\nStep 6 - Serving static files\nSo we know how to send back a simple message. But what if you want to send back\na whole HTML page, or an image?\nThings like HTML files, images etc are known as static assets. If you want\nyour server to \"serve\" static assets back to the browser, you need to do\nsomething different than just using the res.send() method.\nTo be able to send any file from the server we need a special, built-in\nmiddleware function that comes with Express: express.static(). Read more\nabout it here.\nSay we want to serve all the static assets in our \"public\" folder. The\nexpress.static() function will look like this:\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n\n1. Serve static files from your server\nDelete all your app.get endpoint functions, and replace them with the line of\ncode above. Restart your server, refresh your browser and see what happens! If\nyou see a Node Girls CMS, then your static assets have been successfully served.\nHTTP request methods\nAll requests use one of the HTTP methods. The main ones are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\napp.get deals with requests that use the GET HTTP method.\n\nWe will go into these Methods into more details, but for now, think of GET\nas a method for Getting data. POST is for POSTing/inserting new data. PUT\nis for updating. DELETE is for deleting data.\n\nThe POST http request method\nWhen sending data to the server, we use the POST http request method, instead\nof GET.\nLet's try POSTing some text to the server.\nWe're going to add a form to the index.html page, so that you can write your\nblogposts from there.\nOpen up the index.html file in your text editor. If you have a look, you\nshould see this:\n\n    \n\n\nReplace the greyed-out comment with this code snippet:\nCreate a blog post\n\n    \n    Send\n\n\n\nThis form has a text area and a Send button.\nThe action attribute is the endpoint form data will be sent to.\nThe name attribute will be used later to reference the data.\n\nWhen you hit Send, the form will send a POST request to the server, using\nwhatever is in the action attribute as the endpoint. In our case it's\n/create-post.\n\nExercise: Open Chrome Developers tool, click the button and see what\nhappens.\n\nReceiving the blog post on the server\n\nData doesn't come through the server in one go; it flows to the server in a\nstream. Think of a stream as water flowing from a tap into a bucket. Your\njob is to collect this water in the server.\n\nIf we were writing a pure Node server, we would have to think about how to\ncollect the stream of data properly. But luckily for us, Express handles all\nof that stuff under the hood.\n\nAll you need to do is define a route to deal with requests that come through\non the /create-post endpoint.\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of a simple GET route in Express:\napp.get(\"/hello-world\", function(req, res) {\n  res.send(\"Hello there!\");\n});\n\n\nExercise: This time we want to define a route to deal with a POST\nrequest not a GET. What do you think you would need to do differently?\nExperiment and see if you can define a route for the /create-post endpoint!\nFor now, make your /create-post handler simply do this: console.log('I am /create-post endpoint').\n\n\nExtracting the blog post\nNow the contents of your blogpost is hidden in your req object somewhere.\nNormally you would extract it using req.body. Try to console.log req.body\nnow.\nGetting undefined? Not to worry, that's normal. When data has been POSTed to\nthe server as FormData, we need to do things slightly differently to access\nthe data that's come through in the request.\nWe need another middleware function. Something that can get extract the contents\nout of the special FormData object. For this we will use express-formidable.\nexpress-formidable is another Express middleware. It will extract the form\ndata from the request and make it available to you when you do req.fields.\nThis time though, express-formidable is not built-in, we need to explicitly\ninstall it.\nIn your terminal, install express-formidable\nnpm install express-formidable --save\n\nrequire express-formidable so you can use it in your code. You can't use\ndashes in JavaScript variable names, so just call it const formidable.\nconst formidable = require(\"express-formidable\");\n\nNow add this towards the top of your server, after your requires and\napp.use(express.static('public')), but before your /create-post endpoint:\napp.use(formidable());\n\nNow inside your /create-post function, add:\nconsole.log(req.fields);\n\nRefresh your server and have another go at writing a blogpost.\nYou should now see an object in the console. The key should be blogpost, just\nlike the name attribute in the form on the HTML page. The value of blogpost\nwill be your message!\n\nExercise: Try putting app.use(formidable()); at the end of the file\n(after the create-post but before starting the server)\nWhat is a middleware in Express? Middleware functions are functions that\nhave access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the\nnext function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function\nis a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the\nmiddleware succeeding the current middleware. Read more on\nthe Express documentation\n\nStep 8 - Saving your blog post\nRight now, your precious blog posts aren't being saved anywhere, which is a bit\nof a shame. Let's do something about that.\nYou'll note that in the data folder there's a new file called posts.json.\nIf you look at posts.json will see there's already one blog post there. The\nformat is:\n{\n    [timestamp]: [blog post message]\n}\n\nWe've used a timestamp as the key so that the blog posts are listed in\nchronological order. Also, it's a record of when the blog post was created.\nWriting to your hard drive\nAnytime a blog post comes through to the server, we want to save the data on\nyour computer's hard drive. To do this, we need to use a built-in Node module:\nfs, which stands for 'file-system'.\nBuilt-in Node modules - core Node modules - are rather like the built-in\nExpress middleware functions. Only difference is that where you need to have\ninstalled Express to use Express middleware functions, the core Node modules\ncome automatically with Node itself.\nTo use fs, you'll need to require it at the top of your server file:\nconst fs = require(\"fs\");\n\nThe method we need to write to your hard drive is fs.writeFile.\nfs.writeFile(\"path/to/file\", yourData, function(error) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the data you want to write\nArgument 3: the callback function\n\nThe 'path/to/file' will be replaced with the actual path to the file you want to\nwrite to. If it doesn't exist, fs.writeFile cleverly creates one for you. But\nwe already have posts.json, so not to worry.\nReading from your hard drive\nTo read data that's already there, you would use fs.readFile. The way to use\nfs.readFile is very similar to fs.writeFile:\nfs.readFile(\"path/to/file\", function(error, file) {\n  // do something\n});\n\n\nArgument 1: the location of the file you want to write to\nArgument 2: the callback function\n\nYou'll notice that fs.readFile's callback function takes a second argument.\nThat argument would be the file you're reading.\nLet's read the data from the posts.json file. Make sure you've required the\nfs core Node module at the top of your server file somewhere.\nAdd this code to your server (put it anywhere after the requires for now):\nfs.readFile(__dirname + \"/data/posts.json\", function(error, file) {\n  console.log(file);\n});\n\n(__dirname is a Node global object that gives you a path to current working\ndirectory. It's handy if we want to avoid writing the whole path out in full.)\nIf you restart the server, you'll probably see something like this:\n\n\nThis is actually the contents of your posts.json file, but in a format called\na buffer. To make it a bit more human-readable, you can console.log the file\nto a string, like this:\nconsole.log(file.toString());\n\nfile is in JSON format right now. If we want to access the blog post message\ninside file, we need to parse it from JSON back to a JavaScipt object.\nAdd this next bit of code to your fs.readFile's callback function:\nconst parsedFile = JSON.parse(file);\n\nNow parsedFile is a normal JavaScript object, and we can access the data\ninside it.\nOk, so we've talked about JSON and we've talked about reading and writing files.\nYou now have the power to save new blog post data to your hard drive! Work with\nyour partner and your mentor to see if you can figure the next steps out on your\nown.\nHere's a breakdown of what you want to achieve:\n\nWhen new blog post data comes through, read from posts.json to access its\ncontents\nAdd your new blog post data to the old ones.\nWrite your new combined data back to the posts.json file.\n\nThings to remember\n\nfs.writeFile() normally overwrites the target file you've given it. Chances\nare you don't want to lose all your old blog posts every time you get a new\none, so think about how you can combine fs.readFile() and fs.writeFile()\nto prevent overwriting.\n\nYou will need to convert between JSON and a JavaScript object several times.\nJSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() are what you need.\n\n\nOh by the way, if you want to get the current timestamp, use the JavaScript\nDate.now() method.\nStep 9 - Displaying your blog posts\nSo now we're saving the blog posts to the server. Time to get them and display\nthem on the page!\nIf you look inside public/script.js, there's a whole bunch of JavaScript code\nin there. Don't worry about what all the code means, just know that it's\nresponsible for sending a request to GET old blog posts and display them on the\npage underneath \"Recent Posts\".\nscript.js is trying to load existing posts by making a GET request. Look\ninside script.js and see if you can find any useful endpoints.\nYour script.js file will want to receive the JSON containing your blog posts.\nYour job is to make that happen!\nExpress has a handy method called res.sendFile() that makes it easy to send\nfiles back to the client. Feel free to use this with your JSON.\nIf all goes well, you should have a fully functional CMS!\n"},"node-db/week-15/workshop.html":{"url":"node-db/week-15/workshop.html","title":"Hotel Workshop","keywords":"","body":"\nCYF Hotel Workshop\n\nIntroduction\nProblem Statement\nUser Journeys\nTeam Work\nLearning Outcomes\n\nIntroduction\nBrief: Designing a hotel website\nClient: CYF Hotels Ltd\nDate: 28 January 2018\nFacilitators: CYF Mentors\nNow that you are almost a full-stack developer, we would like you to make us a website for our imaginary hotel.\nSince you have a limited time, there is already an empty boilerplate project for you to take and build on top of.\nIn keeping with times, we are using the Lean model and only developing features that we see necessary for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\nProblem Statement\nCurrently hotel website is a little empty.

Follow the instructions for\nyour platform (Windows, Linux or OS X).\nAlso download and install RoboMongo from https://robomongo.org/download.\nOpen two instances of terminal. Run mongod - this will start MongoDB then run\nmongo on the other window.\n\nIn the mongo shell (terminal) - run the command version() and you should get\nthe version of Mongo printed on the terminal\nDatabases overview\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhat is a database role?\nWhy do we need a database? Why not just use the file system?\nWhat would make a good database?\n\n\nWhy a database?\n\nDatabases can store very large numbers of records efficiently (they take up\nlittle space).\nYou can have strucutre on your data\nYou can query for data in a database, you can sort data, add/edit/delete data\nYou can optimise a database to make searches (queries) quicker\nYou can relate pieces of data to each other to avoid duplication which makes\nyour information more reliable and less prone to errors\nACID\nIn computer science, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is\na set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity\neven in the event of errors, power failures, etc.\n\n\nDatabases can handle very large data sets.\nDatabases are concurrent; multiple users can use them at the same time without\ncorrupting the data.\nDatabases scale well\n\nRelational and non-relational databases\nThere are mainly two flavours of databases used commercially these days.\nRelational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases.\nRelational databases include MySQL, Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle\nDatabase and many others. They've been around for a long time and they're used\nfor all kind of applications.\nNon-relational databases are relatively new and they include the likes of\nMongoDB, Casandra, Neo4j etc...\nMongo\n\nMongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database\nprogram. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like\ndocuments.\n\nBSON (JSON-like document)\nIn a Relational database, information is organised in rows in tables with\npredefined columns.\nIn a non-relational database, information is organised in documents. MongoDB\nstores data records in a format similar to JSON called BSON. BSON is a binary\nrepresentation of JSON documents, though it contains more data types than JSON.\n\nLet's look at this database table Students containing information about\nstudents participating in a course \n\nExercise: What are the columns, rows and tables?\n\n\n\nExercise: Open https://jsonlint.com/ and write a JSON representation of two\nrows in the Students table example. Click Validate JSON and make sure the\ndocument is valid.\n\nAre there any alternative representations you can think of?\n\n\nBSON is very similar to JSON. It contains more data types than JSON, it also\nallows the field names to not be quoted. Read more information about the\nformat - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/.\nMongo Shell\nLet's go to mongo shell and start interacting with our database system.\n1. create a database\nOn the shell, type the command use profile The shell should respond with\nswitched to db profile. At this stage, the database does not necessarily\nexist once we start adding information (collections) then the database will be\ncreated and the collection added to them.\nTo check the current database, run db.\n2. create a collection\nNow let's create our first collection. Make sure you're using the profile\ndatabase. Run db and it should print profile on the terminal.\nWe will insert a simple document representing a student.\n\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Habiiba', country: 'Somalia', assignedMentors:\n['Ashleigh'] })\n\nYou should get a confirmation with the number of records inserted.\nYou can also insert more than one document at a time. Run this command\n\ndb.students.insertMany([{ name: 'Khalid', country: 'Yemen' }, { name:\n'Yohannes', country: 'Ethiopia', assignedMentors: ['Michael'] }])\n\nrun the command db.students.count() and you should get that you have 3\ndocuments.\n3. Querying data\nQuerying is one of the most important reasons that we use databases. SQL is the\nlanguage used for querying relational databases, In MongoDB, we can use the\nmethod db.collection.find, passing a query in the form of a JSON object as a\nfirst parameter.\nLet's try few queries:\nGet all the students from Ethiopia.\n\ndb.students.find({country: 'Ethiopia'})\n\nWe can also provide an extra parameter projection to define what fields we\nwant back from the query.\nFor example, if we're only interested in the name\ndb.students.find({ country: \"Ethiopia\" }, { name: 1 });\n// you can also use { name: true }\n\nLet's add another two students to the collection\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Sudan', assignedMentors:\n['Michael'] })\nand\ndb.students.insertOne({ name: 'Mohamed', country: 'Syria', assignedMentors:\n['Michael', 'Ashleigh'] })\nNow let's query for all the students that have Michael as mentor.\ndb.students.find({ assignedMentors: [\"Michael\"] });\n\nWhat if we want to find any student whose name is \"Mohamed\" AND whose country is\n\"Sudan\". You can then use the logical query operator $and.\ndb.students.find({\n  $and: [{ name: \"Mohamed\" }, { country: \"Sudan\" }]\n});\n\nNotice that name and country are case-sensitive.\nExercise:\n\nFind all students for whom Ashleigh is an assigned mentor.\nFind all students that have Michael as their only mentor\nFind students whose name is Mohamed OR Michael is their only mentor\nRead about the\n$in operator\nand use it to find students whose country is either Sudan or Ethiopia.\nLook at the other\nComparison Query Operators\nand the\nLogical Query Operators\nand use few of them.\n\nKey Concepts so far\nIn Mongo, a database contains collections that contain BSON\ndocuments. We can use the mongo shell to interact with our Mongo\ndatabases. The query documents are used to specify a selection filter using\nquery operators\nto search for documents in the collections.\n\nCheckpoint: Do you understand all the words highlighed in the last paragraph?\n\nNode with Mongo\nSo far we've been connecting to Mongo using the Mongo shell. Mongo has drivers\nfor most major programming languages but it's especially popular with NodeJS\napplications as its API and Query model is very close to JavaScript syntax and\npatterns.\nLet's start wiring Node with MongoDB as a datastore.\n\nFork and Clone the project\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop.\nrun npm install then npm run dev to run the application with autoreload -\nGo to the browser and make sure it's up and running.\n\nInstall the MongoDB Node.js Driver npm install mongodb --save\n\nLet's add an endpoint api/students that returns a json containing all the\nstudents that we've been saving to the database from the shell.\n\n\nGo to the file controllers/apiController, on top of the file, require the\nmodule\nconst MongoClient = require(\"mongodb\").MongoClient;\n\nthen add an endpoint for /students\nrouter.get(\"/students\", (req, res) => {\n  const mongoConnection = \"mongodb://localhost:27017/profile\";\n\n  MongoClient.connect(mongoConnection, (err, db) => {\n    const cursor = db.collection(\"students\").find({});\n    cursor.toArray((error, students) => {\n      db.close();\n      res.json(students);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nGo to your browser /api/students and you should see a JSON containing the\ndocuments we've added to the students collection earlier.\n\nExercise: Let's step through the previous code and understand it line by line.\n\nWhat is a Mongo conection string?\n\n\n[Connection String documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/) - The connection string follows this format: `mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]` - what parts do you have in our connection string right now?\nExercise\nNow let's change the api/posts to also use the mongo database instead of the\njson file under /data.\n\nFirst step is to save the posts in the database. Similar to what we did\nwith students collection, use the Mongo shell to create a new collection\ncalled posts and use insertMany to insert all the documents.\n\nChange the endpoint /api/posts to read its contents from the database (very\nsimilar code to what we wrote in /api/students endpoint). Go to\nhttp://localhost:3000/api/posts and make sure you see the posts. Update a\ndocument in the database (either check the documentation for\nupdate\nor use RoboMongo) and see if it gets reflected.\n\nOnce you have the endpoint running, delete the json data/posts.json.\n\nNow if you go to the root of your application http://localhost:3000, you\nwill encounter an error as it will still try to read from the file system but\nwe deleted the file. Update the / endpoint to also get the Posts from the\ndatabase.\n\n\nExercise Part 2: Refactor the code\nEven though our code does what's supposed to do, it has several issues. We have\na lot of duplicate code - both endpoints GET /api/posts and GET / do the\nsame call to the database and then do something with it. It's only that\nsomething (the callback) that is different so let's refactor the code to\neliminate duplication (DRY).\n\nThe variable mongoConnection is declared multiple times, that means that if\nthe connection string changes then we need to change multiple places causing\npossibilities of missing one instance and causing errors. Let's declare it\nonce and use it in the rest of the app.\n\nWhy is it bad to have duplicate code?\n\nExtract the Mongo calls to seperate functions. Extract the route for\n/api/students into a function named getStudents\n\nWhat will the function signature be?\n\nRemember the Single Responsibility Principle - the route handlers have\nmultiple responsibilities right now: Connecting to Mongo, getting the data\nthen sending it back as a response.\n\nMove the new function to a new file called helpers/db-client.js, export the\nfunctions and use them in the original file.\n\nDo you remember how we create modules and use them? module.exports and\nrequire.\n\nDo the same for the /posts\n\n\nExercise Part 3: Deploy our app\nLet's deploy our Database-Driven Application to Heroku. If you don't remember\nthe steps, refresh your memory from\nthe previous lesson.\nOnce you're finsihed, Go to your application on heroku and see if it is working\nproperly.\nIt should not be working.\nCan you have a guess on what went wrong? To see what's happening on the heroku\nserver, run heroku logs from the terminal and check the logs.\nMongo on Heroku\nHeroku, AWS and other cloud services allows us to use databases and other\nservices on the cloud without having to maintain physical servers making it easy\nto scale, monitor costs and build good solutions in general.\nWe've already used DynamoDB on AWS. This week, we'll do MongoDB.\n\nGo to Heroku dashboard\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nClick on your app name in the dashboard. Go to Resources, under addons,\nsearch for mLab MongoDB and choose it. When you're prompted with this\nscreen - click on Provision.\n\n\n\nThe new MongoDB service will appear under Resources - you can click on it and it\nwill take you to a web interface to administer your MongoDB instance.\n\nGo to the Settings and click on Reveal Config Vars. You should see the\na variable called MongoDB_URI - that is the connection string for the MongoDB\ninstance on Heroku (on mLab used by Heroku).\n\n\nSo how can we use this connection string instead of our local one?\n\nEnvironment variables\nIn NodeJS, The process.env property returns an object containing the user\nenvironment. Environment variables allow us to configure different aspects of\nour application based on the environment where it's running - so for instance,\nwhen we run our application locally, we want to connect to the local MongoDB but\non Heroku, we want to connect to a different one.\nConnection strings are typically saved and used as Environment variables, other\ntypical uses are with passwords, secrets, URLs of other services etc... Anything\nthat is environment specific and that shouldn't live in the source code.\n\nSecurity tip: Never add passwords, connection strings or any sensitive\ninformation in your source code, always use an Environment variable.\n\nServices like Heroku and AWS can then use these environment variables to\nconfigure aspects of the application.\n\nWe've already used one Environment variable for Heroku before - what was it?\nExercise: Use the environment MongoDB_URI to connect to MongoDB on Heroku,\nbut fallback to localhost connection string if there is no environment\nvariable provided.\n\n\nCommit and push the changes to Heroku and see if it works.\n\nHomework\nRefer to the MongoDB/Node workshop for the Homework tasks -\nhttps://github.com/CodeYourFuture/mongo-node-workshop\n\nRead https://www.upguard.com/articles/mysql-vs-mongodb\n\nResources\n\nWhy use a database\nDatabases and Collections\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/databases-and-collections/\nDocuments in MongoDB - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/\nPractice on a web Mongo shell\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb_terminal_online.php\nEnvironment Variables -\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sql-comparison/\n\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","keywords":"","body":"Contributing\nBefore starting, please read the following general guidelines and\nChecklist for a lesson.\nParticipate in the discussion if you'd like.\nThere are discussions\nabout each module and every class in a module, make sure to go through them (or\nadd a new issue/discussion point).\nTo contribute to the Code Your Future syllabus, fork and open a pull request to\nthis repository.\nContributions are strictly through approved Pull Requests, even for\nadministrators of the repo.\nSince this repository is the blueprint of our syllabus we allow different\ncohorts to adapt to their classes' needs, and also update their syllabus\nversions to reflect how the class goes.\nWe should always make sure master is relevant and up to date for future\nclasses with the feedback from the on-going teaching in each CYF chapter.\nLegacy versions\nMentors should point the students to the individual classes on Github (not the\ngitbook links) to allow them to get familiar with Git and Github, and to focus\non the individual class.

Take a while to think carefully about the question. This is an important skill. There is a great guide to writing good questions here\nIf you cannot get an answer from your fellow students, post your question in your class public channel, @ the mentor for the class that covered the topic and we will reply as soon as we can.\n\n"},"html-css/mentor-guide.html":{"url":"html-css/mentor-guide.html","title":"HTML/CSS Mentors guide","keywords":"","body":"Mentors Guide for HTML/CSS module\n\nLesson 1\nLesson 2\nLesson 3\n\nHTML/CSS 1 - Mentor's Outline\nThis outline provides tips to help mentors guide students to the best answers or outcomes for the lesson topics and exercises.\nHTML Syntax\nThis is an opportunity for any students who are struggling to get another pass at the basics. Even if it seems like some students get it quickly, try not to rush through this section.\nWhen conducting the parent/child tags exercise, don't forget to point out that the first  tag is both a parent and a child.\nCode Walkthrough\nWhy don't we put everything in one file?\nDiscuss:\n\nKeeping data separate from display\nKeeping code organised into manageable parts\nSyntax highlighting in code editors\nLinting Tools\nWorking in large teams with narrow skill-sets\n\nSemantic HTML\nHTML elements with the following classes should receive the following semantic tags/attributes:\n\n.site-header -> \n.navbar -> \n.primary-content -> role=\"main\"\n.article ->  (check in primary column and sidebar)\n.sidebar-content -> \n.site-footer -> \n\nWho benefits when we write \"semantic\" HTML?\nSearch engines, anyone with a visual impairment who uses a screen reader. Reinforce the distinction between data and display. Data should be meaningful regardless of display.\nCSS Selectors\nStudents may need more or less review depending on how much they remember from their application process. If students are struggling with the basics, have them go through this CSS Introduction course, starting with the CSS Syntax lesson. Mentors should help guide them through and identify where they're struggling.\nStudents should set the button background color using the .btn-primary selector, and adjust the white button using the .btn-secondary selector. If they use the .btn selector, they'll effect both buttons. When they do that, use it as a lesson in how Object-Oriented CSS works and how to choose the right selector.\nBox Model\nFor the second exercise, the answer will look something like this:\n.nav-link {\n  border: 1px solid transparent;\n}\n.nav-link:hover,\n.nav-link:focus {\n  border-color: #ce5f31;\n}\n\nGit\nThis will be the most challenging for students. Let them fail and try again until they get it.\nHomework\nMake sure they know that the Responsive Web Design Fundamentals course will take up the majority of their homework time, even though it's really preparation for the next class.\nHTML/CSS 2 - Mentor's Outline\nThis outline provides tips to help mentors guide students to the best answers or outcomes for the lesson topics and exercises.\nResponsive Web Design\nDevices to brainstorm together:\n\nPhones\nTablets\nLaptops\nDesktop computers\nGaming consoles (Playstation/Xbox)\nApple Watch\nSmart devices (fridges, washing machines, TVs)\nScreen readers\nCrawlers (search engines)\n\nUse this list to illustrate the range of device sizes we build for. Reinforce the separation between data and display.\nMedia Queries\nWhen completing the exercises, make sure they use a \"mobile-first\" technique. They shouldn't shrink the text on small screens, but enlarge it on bigger screens.\n/* Don't */\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n  .jumbotron .display-3 {\n     font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Do */\n.jumbotron .display-3 {\n  font-size: 3rem;\n}\n@media (min-width: 480px) {\n  .jumbotron .display-3 {\n     font-size: 4.5rem;\n  }\n}\n\nWhen completing the second exercise, make sure they're only modifying the buttons in the jumbotron. The button in the header shouldn't be effected.\nContent Layout: Flexbox\nThis lesson is really just intended to get them a bit familiar with flexbox, media queries and thinking about different viewports when doing their layouts. Make sure that students are not relying on Bootstrap's grid when completing these exercises. Make sure they're only using flexbox in min-width media queries, and that they're applying sensible class naming patterns and wrapping elements where necessary.\nWhen they add a background and border to the \"Learn More\" articles, make sure they're adding padding so the text doesn't go right up to the edge. If they are using px units, nudge them towards em and explain that em is often preferred because it scales well when you need to change font size for different viewports.\nHomework\nWhen checking their use of flexbox in their webpage, make sure they're using gutters where appropriate and that they're using the kinds of design patterns you would expect to see on a website (ie - items line up, text is proportionate, etc).\nHTML/CSS 3 - Mentor's Outline\nThis outline provides tips to help mentors guide students to the best answers or outcomes for the lesson topics and exercises.\nOpen-source HTML/CSS Frameworks\nUsing the Navbar color schemes, use the browser's dev tools to show how changing the navbar classes in the example website changes the look based on Bootstrap.\nUsing the Card example, try to illustrate the way tags are nested inside of each other in a specific hierarchy. Emphasise the practice of paying close attention to documentation and picking up on minor details.\nGit Branching Excercise\nA mentor should act as a remote repository and have a large sheet of paper. Students should have 4-5 sheets of paper.\n\nThe mentor should write their name at the top of the sheet, and write master below that.\nStudents should clone the main sheet on one of their sheets (git clone), with their name and master on the sheet.\nStudents should take a new sheet of paper. Copy their main sheet, and replace master with feature-branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).\nStudents should write their country of origin on their feature-branch sheet. Then show it to the mentor (git commit, git push and pull request).\nThe mentor should \"merge\" each pull request by copying the country of origin onto their sheet.\nTake a moment to indicate how their local sheet have divered from the mentor's sheet.\nAsk the students to take their master sheet and copy the mentor's sheet (git checkout master and git pull upstream master).\nHave the students take their feature-branch sheet, ball it up, and throw it away (git branch -D feature-branch).\n\nSpend some time with this Git Cheatsheet. Point to your sheets and their sheets and ask them to identify what's in the Upstream Repository, Local Repository, Index and Workspace. Then walk through the whole process from Workspace up:\n\nA student makes a change on their sheet. This change is in the Workspace.\nA student does a git add. This change is now in the Index.\nA student does a git commit. This change is now in the Local Repository.\nA student does a git push. This change is now in the Remote Repository.\n\nPersonal Websites\nThe goal of this exercise is to identify students who are struggling to keep up. Try to identify where a student is struggling:\n\nCan they find their files quickly?\nAre they using the command line when appropriate?\nDo they understand how their HTML and CSS interact?\nDo they seem to understand syntax, or are they writing code in the wrong place?\n\nIf you find a student who is struggling with any of these basics, try to work through them together, then give them a short assignment where they need to do something on their own.\nThere will be several students who have the basics down. If they do, push them on some of the higher-level abstract concepts, like re-usable HTML/CSS components, and using CSS specificity cleverly (eg - basic and primary buttons). Beyond that, let them read up on HTML Forms (links in the resources), do some of the advanced suggestions in the syllabus, or challenge them to read and implement BEM naming syntax.\n"}}}
