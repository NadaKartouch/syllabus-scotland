# Homework

1. Please Make sure you have finished the bookshelf project, including the
   stretch goals
1. Work in pairs to do _Weather App Exercise_ and send the link to your
   repository on _your trello card_.

## Weather App

Working in pairs, build a web app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a
location of your choice. It is up to you how you divide the work, you can each
do a bit or have one person focus on UI / UX and another on JS code.

One of you should create a repository on github and make sure the other team
member has access to push to it.
[Use this guide to help you](https://codeyourfuture.github.io/syllabus-master/others/making-a-pull-request.html).

Read and use the
[OpenWeatherMap weather forecast API](http://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve
the current 5 day weather forecast. Use `fetch` with this API key in your code:
`33fb7454eb75c6a062a86f7f0ee2695a`
([more examples](http://openweathermap.org/current).)

* Create context document as a `README.md` file which includes:

  * **Brief** The problem you are trying to solve
  * **Core Functionality** Functionality your app does
  * **Research** you did for making the app - could be just links or
    descriptions to any sites or apps that do tacke this problem already
  * **Target Audience** who will be using your app
  * Any other documentation relevant to running the app - details the
    contribution of each student - explains current functionality as well as any
    fixes you would add if you had more time

* Make sure your project tackles:
  * **Visual appeal** A well thought out, visually appealling web page
  * **Responsive** design that works well with different screen widths and on
    mobile devices
  * **Good Code** Well named variable names and functions and short and concise
    functions with a clear purpose

**Stretch goals**

* Allow user to input or select other locations for the weather forecast
* Add any functionality you think would be usefull to the users of your app
