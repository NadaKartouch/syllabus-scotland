# Notes

- Finsih the new concepts asap (Objects and arrays), then start with the exercises on https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/JS-Core-1-Exercises that they cloned last time. Solve the first few together, show them how you code solution (write pseudo code first), involve them in coding in a group - then let them do something similar themselves (or delete the code and let them do it) - do that for the first few times, so that they can see your thought process (when do you know you need to use a loop, a conditional etc..)

- At some point, with one of the exercises, let them try to find a solution in Google and let the mentors leave them alone - maybe them to what to Google  like "how to loop through an array in JavaScript", don't let the mentors help them until at least they googled something and began writing some code.

- Let's cover Arrays, Object then go back to useful methods on Arrays (as opposed to do it straight after arrays) to make sure we cover the topics they need for the exercises. If we don't have time, we tell them to research the Array methods part.

- They wrote the code on JS-Exercises-Core repo last time. They can continue on that same repo, just let them create a separate file for each section (arrays.js, objects.js etc..)

- In the class,  don't get into unnecessary details, ever. Keep it as simple as possible (even if it means sometimes that what we say is not 100% accurate - it doesn't matter at this stage). Let's focus on them starting to think logically, understand the problem before starting to code, what they're doing (rather than copying code blindly).



- ? Not sure if class 3 should be DOM? we might change the research depending on how the class goes.

# Arrays
To start with, let's start by create a collection of the names of the students in the class without an Array.

it will end up being being something like:

```js
var student1 = 'mohamed';
var student2 = 'habiiba';
var ...
```

Why this is bad? We remind them about the principle we talked about
- DRY: Do not repeat yourself
- Bad variable names

Then we tell them that JS and all other languages have a solution for that - which is Arrays
